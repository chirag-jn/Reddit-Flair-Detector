Political,[ASK INDIA] Explain the current Karnataka Political Crisis,67,ce7535,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ce7535/ask_india_explain_the_current_karnataka_political/,38,1563361252.0,Please explain the current political situation or crisis in Karnataka,naveen_reloaded," Remember in school when some spoilt kid did not get batting he would just take his bat and threaten to go home? He would never really go home because you were his only friends, but that did not stop him from threatening and throwing a tantrum. 

These politicians are just nostalgic about their past. Congress+JDS formed Govt to keep BJP out. BJP was desperate and was trying to make MLAs switch sides.

 They tapped into the MLA base who did not get ministries and got them to resign this time.

So numbers will favour BJP for Govt formation. Current Govt will fall by tomorrow. Mota Bhai is on a shopping spree There is an editorial piece about it in today's The Hindu. Give a read. These MLA's cannot defect to BJP because of the anti defection law, so they are resigning instead, this will eventually give BJP more seats allowing them to form the government. 

This type of horse trading is the worst and no other decent democracy would allow shit like this to happen. What a fucking joke. nothing to explain...it's the best example of worst politicians in India. Sad that we common citizens take elections so seriously to choose these idiots as our leaders.. Some Karnataka MLA's of Congress and JDS are fed up with Kumaraswamy and want to resign. Speaker being INC member decides to initiate disqualification against these MLA's without deciding on their resignations. MLA's who resign can contest bypolls and become ministers those who are disqualified cannot contest bypolls for the current session of the assembly.  So these MLA's want to join BJP and contest from BJP for the bypolls and speaker wants to fear them by disqualification to take back their resignations. Whatever may be the result the Congress and JDS government is in minority and is taking important decisions. [Why has this old video of comedian Jaspal Bhatti resurfaced?

Political,Rahul Gandhi resigns as President of Congress,1112,c8lydy,https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/i-am-no-longer-congress-president-affirms-rahul-gandhi20190703143743/,413,1562174603.0,,GA3RU," This just might be the best thing to happen to Congress off late. And to Rahul Gandhi too. About time! No matter one's views, India deserves a strong  opposition. 

I'm not sure who should succeed him, but it should be a non-Gandhi who has done good work in their state and is preferably younger. Someone like Sachin Pilot? Here's the full resignation letter from Rahul Gandhi. 


>It is an honour for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation. I owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love.

>As President of the Congress Party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress President.

>Rebuilding the party requires hard decisions and numerous people will have to be made accountable for the failure of 2019. It would be unjust to hold others accountable but ignore my own responsibility as President of the party.

>Many of my colleagues suggested that I nominate the next Congress President. While it is important for someone new to lead our party, it would not be correct for me to select that person. Ours is a party with a profound history and heritage, one of struggle and dignity that I deeply respect. It is woven into the fabric of India and I trust the party will make the best decision regarding who can lead us with courage, love and fidelity.

>Immediately after resigning, I suggested to my colleagues in the Congress Working Committee that the way forward would be to entrust a group of people with the task of beginning the search for a new President. I have empowered them to do so and committed my full support to this process and a smooth transition.

>My fight has never been a simple battle for political power. I have no hatred or anger towards the BJP but every living cell in my body instinctively resists their idea of India. This resistance arises because my being is permeated with an Indian idea that is and has always been in direct conflict with theirs. This is not a new battle; it has been waged on our soil for thousands of years. Where they see differences, I see similarity. Where they see hatred, I see love. What they fear, I embrace.

>This compassionate idea permeates the hearts of millions and millions of my beloved fellow citizens. It is this idea of India that we will now vehemently defend.

>The attack on our country and our cherished Constitution that is taking place is designed to destroy the fabric of our nation. In no way, shape or form am I stepping back from this fight. I am a loyal soldier of the Congress party and a devoted son of India and will continue to serve and protect her till my last breath.


>We fought a strong and dignified election. Our campaign was one of brotherhood, tolerance and respect for all of India’s people, religions and communities. I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it. I have learned so much from the spirit and dedication of our workers and party members, men and women who have taught me about love and decency.

>A free and fair election requires the neutrality of a country’s institutions; an election cannot be fair without arbiters – a free press, an independent judiciary, and a transparent election commission that is objective and neutral. Nor can an election be free if one party has a complete monopoly on financial resources.

>We didn’t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution of which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.

>The stated objectives of the RSS, the capture of our country’s institutional structure, is now complete. Our democracy has been fundamentally weakened. There is a real danger that from now on, elections will go from being a determinant of India’s future to a mere ritual.

>This capture of power will result in unimaginable levels of violence and pain for India. Farmers, unemployed youngsters, women, tribals, Dalits and minorities are going to suffer the most. The impact on our economy and nation’s reputation will be devastating. The Prime Minister’s win does not negate the breadth of corruption allegations against him; no amount of money and propaganda can ever hide the light of the truth.

>The Indian nation must unite to reclaim and resuscitate our institutions. The instrument of this resuscitation will be the Congress party.

>To achieve this important task, the Congress Party must radically transform itself. Today the BJP is systematically crushing the voice of the Indian people. It is the duty of the Congress Party to defend these voices. India has never and will never be one voice. It is and always will be a symphony of voices. That is the true essence of Bharat Mata.


>Thank you to the thousands of Indians, both at home and abroad, who have sent me letters and messages of support. I will, of course, continue to fight for the ideals of the Congress Party with all my strength. I am available to the party whenever they require my services, input or advice. To those who support the Congress ideology, especially our dedicated and beloved karyakarta, I have absolute faith in our future and the utmost love for you. It is a habit in India that the powerful cling to power, no one sacrifices power. But we will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle. I was born a Congressman, this party has always been with me and is my life’s blood and forever that way it shall remain.

>Jai Hind. Lol. Party members are actually asking him to stay. ""After ages, I am free!"" Dibs on the seat. Have not been following Indian news much since the elections. Who could the next leader of the INC be? If he had done this before, they could have diluted the dynasty tag, at least in the literal sense. But Modi vs WHO? WHO ? WHO ?....now in Arnab's studio when he asks this question only sound will be ...crickets! Well if a male Gandhi heir resigns from politics it should be an indicator of a grim and dark future. His resignation letter
https://mobile.twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1146359704815194112 Tomorrow's news : party workers urge RG to take back his resignation.

This can continue forever. Longest resignation ever, has been going on for 3 months now. He will probably get re-hired once the clueless regional leaders start fighting each other. Shashi Tharoor! I guess we will all just ignore that Rahul setup that Congress data cell that basically fed them a bunch of bogus data and information which led to this poll debacle. The power of marketing and pr can do, to finish off a guy forever. Seems like he is just fed up of politics , good  for him to resign. It will be interesting to see how congress will cope with the loss. BJP's 🌟 campanier is out. No matter what people say i have utmost respect for Rahul Gandhi.....he never used crass words and never spew filth at other people and maintained his dignity throughout but alas that's just not indian politics i hope you best in life ahead. Huge loss to BJP! Time to appoint a puppet and pull the strings from behind without any accountability. Comes After 2months actually when he said he will.  Why So much of tantrum - could have been easily done. Not for long. He will courageously, efficiently and magnanimously return to save the party. He probably wants to take a long vacation before doing the come back. Just read the letter he wrote. The man has made so many valid points. https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/story/here-s-how-sonia-gandhi-replaced-sitaram-kesri-as-congress-president-1391491-2018-11-19

`


>Sonia Gandhi resisted all the pressure from ""the loyalist"" Congressmen to join the party. The Rao government was voted out in 1996. Sonia Gandhi did not campaign in the election. The BJP won 161 seats and the Congress got 140.

>Suddenly in the winters of 1997, Sonia Gandhi announced that she would campaign for the Congress party in Lok Sabha election due for March 1998. Sitaram Kesri was the Congress president at the time.

>The change in leadership equation in the Congress was swift.

>Sonia Gandhi joined the party in December 1997 at its plenary session in then Calcutta. She addressed her first election rally in Tamil Nadu, the state where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.

>In January, Sitaram Kesri welcomed the decision by Sonia Gandhi to join the Congress and campaign for the party in an interview with India Today.

>Sitaram Kesri said, [""Sonia has come as a savior.""](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/interview/story/19980119-sonia-gandhi-has-come-as-a-saviour-sitaram-kesri-828188-1998-01-19) By that time it was clear that the Congress could only function under Sonia Gandhi. Demands were being made in the Congress party asking Sitaram Kesri to hand over the reins of the party to Sonia Gandhi.

>But Sitaram Kesri, then 82, wanted to hold on for some time. He had some support in the party but the ""rebel camp"" was in majority. The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution on March 14, 1998 asking Sitaram Kesri to step down as party president.

>The transfer of power in the Congress is often termed as the bloodless coup. It was dramatic and executed by the use of force.

>Sitaram Kesri was reportedly locked in a room in the Congress headquarters on the Akbar Road in New Delhi to prevent him from creating obstacles in Sonia Gandhi entering the office of the Congress president.

>With Sitaram Kesri locked, Sonia Gandhi entered the Congress headquarters triumphant with her supporters shouting slogans.` lol. good riddance. honestly. BJP supporters (crying): Amul Baby, please don't leave. How will we win without you? :D

&#x200B;

Seriously, Rahul and Sonia should now quit politics and leave. This is a golden opportunity for Congress to kick nepotism and dynasty politics out. If a proper new President is elected then maybe they can give the party credibility. If they elect a Gandhi-controlled robot, then the party will just sink further. This guy finally realised that politics is not his cup of tea. I don't hate him on a personal level, as he seems to be a nice person, but he is/was an absolute disaster as Congress President. Go and live a peaceful life, away from incessant hatred and bigotry. This is a land of wolves now. Permanent thailand citizen incoming India needs a reddit party. The strongest opposition! This is a perfect chance for a competent non gandhi women leader to lead a major party like congress. However unlikely it might be i think it will change our political sphere for good.

Edit: Downvoted for stating an opinion. Never change reddit. Oh, thank god! :) The greatest news you can hear. Hopefully now they can rebuild, with people who are much more competent than he was. We need a stronger opposition more than ever Finally! r/notmyjob Not GG Rahul Good for him. Thanks for the memories, Rahul. now, we can start focusing on a new face for the opposition. Best thing to happen to Rahul, Congress and also India cause you need a strong opposition. A one sided government isn't good for India. A fresh face will light the fire under BJP's ass and keep them on their toes. Finally He was never committed to it bye-bye congress, vultures are their way. About time, this is excellent news, India needs a strong opposition in the coming term, someone to question the government’s mistakes competently and not just say “CHOWKIDAR CHOR HAI” Great news. You are a nice person , politics didnt suit you... If I were in his place, I’d just get on the dating scene, try meeting to some Italian hotties and live the lake Como life Hoping for an Icelandic citizenship? Rahul stays or Rahul leaves, win-win for BJP. Baba will enjoy Iduki gold now... After being defeated so many times, BJP (or Bhartiya Jana Sangh) party presidents should have resigned. Did they? no, why are they forcing Rahul then?",2019-07-03 22:53:23
Political,Emperors of Extraction: The Mughals did not make India rich. Claims of their welfarism only buttress a political agenda,39,cdargd,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/emperors-of-extraction-rana-safvi-the-mughals-did-not-make-india-rich-claims-of-their-welfarism-only-buttress-a-political-agenda/story/1/31483.html,11,1563180822.0,,banker_boy2," A case may be made that Akbar and Jahangir were cut from a different cloth than the rest of the Mughals. Babar is open about his hatred of India and its people, as well as lust for its gold, in Babarnama. Its for a reason that Pakistan named their cruise missile Babur. I don’t know if Shah Jahan hated India or not, but his monument to his wife sucked so much money that it caused a famine around Agra. The less said about Aurangzeb the better. Akbar, on the other hand, is a fascinating, multi faceted ruler and was respected by many of his enemies.

Europe started its renaissance around the time the Mughal empire started, and they never looked back. The Mughals were happy being stationary and the gap kept widening. They for example rejected technologies like the printing press even when it was brought to them. The fact that we care way more about a done and dusted past (on both sides of the argument) - almost as if it means more than the shambles right now and in the future - shows our priorities. He seems to have a nice big ol chip on his shoulder.. 

&#x200B;

I dont get this obsession with trying to disprove indian history either way.. pro or anti.. Its some sick obsession which onle points out how insecure some sections of the populace are, they only strive to pull down others rather then rise up. Claims that Mughal emperors did the opposite and were evil invaders are also only to buttress a political agenda. The author is a borderline bigot going by his twitter feed. Not anything to add to this argument, but I won't believe the tiniest dollop of what this dimwit Abhijit Iyer-Mitra says.",2019-07-15 14:23:42
Political,"Is legalization of marijuana in India ever going to be a serious political issue during our lifetime, or are we going to be criminals forever?",87,bvvre5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bvvre5/is_legalization_of_marijuana_in_india_ever_going/,123,1559497404.0,"As a cannabis enthusiast (stoner, pothead), it pains me to see so many countries across the world taking this issue seriously while we're reduced to criminal status by purchasing illegal weed from questionable sources. Can we expect India to take this debate up anytime soon?",diary_of_jain," Get fucking real bro.
We breathing cancerous fucking air and how much you heard about that in the recent elections?
I think we'll get to Mary jane when we get to it. Ramdev Baba to the rescue...

 https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/lifestyle/what-s-hot/story/ramdev-s-patanjali-wants-marijuana-legalised-in-india-social-media-can-t-keep-calm-1165782-2018-02-09 This has been bugging me a lot lately.

Legalization of Marijuana is a half volley for the ruling party to score with the public. Logically they are the Hindu Nationalist party, thumping their chest about glorious ancient past and they are not addressing this facet of that at all. There is not a single public discourse on this. Cannabis *INDICA* is outlawed while whole of the world races ahead in quality, medicinal research, textiles, taxation and Shanti among other things.


The taxation alone is a just cause to pursue the legalization. Try and Do a calculation in your mind about how much the ganja/charas    market in your city is worth anually.

The SKU's range from 50 ki poorhi to 4000 tola.

If this doesn't irk you. Then do a simple water test to check the adulteration in your regular Ganje ka packet waala maal.

90% of the marijuana the people of india consume is below par and 50% of that is just plain shit.

And Oh Lord the Stigma! Cannabis enthusiast? More like ganjedi All hail ramdev, he's pushing for legalization of marijuana. Our country is losing out on a ready to boom market by criminalising Mary Jane. 

Once they ban something in India, it holds (like section 377) the place. There is no looking into it, even as the countries originally responsible for these bans evolve, revoke and move forward. India should adapt to changing times and move forward with innovations in the ganja industry when it’s bound to the surface with more medically proven benefits and India knows it.

Therefore, there is a need for an open discussion regarding this when unregulated criminal markets and increasing number of young people who smokes up can be harmful for a progressive Indian society. It is possible if we come together, make a credible case and demand/vote for it. Start a campaign on how you are a shiv bhakt, and the government is oppressing your religion.

Choose thewir(biased hate the Government) or swaraj (biased protect religion)

Say stuff like Hemant kharkare beat you once ( replace with any other popular Martyr)

Win the ~~election~~ unban Full legalization is far away I think, but decriminalization of medical use might be possible in the near term.

I have been researching the decriminalization/legalization of cannabis in India and it looks quite un-organized to me right now. There used to be The Great Legalization Movement of India, but looks to be defunct now. The clamor in mainstream media has been growing (e.g. an [a recent article](https://qz.com/india/1632037/modi-must-legalise-cannabis-to-tackle-indias-agrarian-distress/), especially around the business/medical aspects of it. At the governmental level the latest was the PMO had asked the [opinion of the Health Ministry](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/check-benefits-of-cannabis-prime-minister-s-office-tells-health-ministry/story-JJWPQSKcway1zX9zbQ7HLN.html). With a new Health Minister, it's anybody's guess.

I think we need learn from the strategies employed the cannabis legalization movements in US and the gay rights movement in India. The roadmap others have followed is:

1. Medical use exception 
2. Decriminalization of recreational use 
3. Legalization. 

The first step is quite attainable and PIL might be a the fastest way. India banned cannabis due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs treaty, but WHO's stance has now changed especially with regards to the medicinal use. Even CSIR is [exploring drugs based off cannabis](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/csir-iiim-boheco-to-develop-cannabis-based-drugs-for-cancer-epilepsy-sickle-cell-anemia/articleshow/66773628.cms). Given the facts, I think the government will have a hard time defending the current NDPS law which outright bans all uses of cannabis flower in the Supreme Court.

The second and third steps will take a long time and I think we need a PR and awareness campaign for it. First we should stop calling it cannabis and instead call it bhang/ganja. These two words have much better recall and brand value to us. Social media can play a big role as well. The use of cannabis is on the rise amongst the youth and we should exploit that.

What's unfortunate is that the West has a lead in legalized marijuana business right now and we are being left out, whereas we are the rightful ""heirs"" of this Industry. India has long historical record of cannabis use. The West forced this ban and are now stealing the market away from us. This narrative has not been given it's due in the mainstream media. India's got bigger problems according to our politicians a bill was presented in the parliament to pass it. But thats a dream at least for the next 20 years I'd say not gonna happen Bc adhe logo ko roti nahi mil rahi, baki logo ko meat nahi khane de rahe. Kisi neta k pass time nahi hai humare Maal fookne ko legal karne me time lagae Actually Shivji used it. So banning it is against kulcha In our country we are still finding if weed/cannabis/marijuana has any health benefits while other countries have started producing cannabis based medicine and are now trying to use it for curing cancer or helping cancer patients. I came across a book which had like 100 diseases that can be cured by marijuana ( tuberculosis, seizures or epilepsy, etc.) People in India are just fucking not showing this. In newspapers, i have never read any benefits of marijuana but only thing that I saw and still see is people getting caught. If people's perceptions is changed about cannabis it will be legalized in a year or two because it will benefit all parties. We'll get quality controlled weed they'll get taxes and job employment might increase with benefits to farmers as well and it will make our healthcare system better by reducing prices that we pay for current chemically produced medicines. I know people who take like 7-8 kinds of medicine a day to treat epilepsy whereas thc oil has been proven to cure epilepsy. That 7 vs 1. Just think about it and your welcome to share your thoughts. [deleted] /r/indianents Here people are trying to make alcohol illegal, and you are expecting them to legalize marijuana. Only way to get it legalize is to elect some weed smoking baba in parliament.

Marijuana could definitely be a good source for revenue.

Fuck the US for its war on drugs.MF are responisble for banning of weed in India in the first place and are now legalizing it in their own country.

It's not that big of a political issue for MPs to bother with and it's also not good for your political image to be pro-alcohol and pro-weed. These issues are of developed countries. These is still alot of shit to be done here. That’s never going to happen. Only vegetarian teetotallers are accepted in India! Those countries had to take serious steps because lot of people were incarcerated for it. Not the case here.

States are banning alcohol one by one and ppl want them to ban it. It's unrealistic to make marijuana use more prevalent people don't want it. Achche din and wale hai mitron, apna time ayega. we don't fucking vote for infrastructure and development and you want marijuana to be a political issue. [deleted] Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with weed but there's so many more pressing issues happening right now than whether weed should be legal or not",2019-06-02 23:13:24

Is there any way for us to make the political parties talk about building ponds and reservoirs?,81,c22c7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c22c7k/chennaite_here_is_there_any_way_for_us_to_make/,30,1560893775.0,"It's crazy how they aren't even talking about it. Even the opposition. It can't go on like this.

PS:
The situation is grim in Chennai but somehow it sounds worse in the media. I guess you could say the dire situation isn't the case in all of Chennai. It depends on the locality. The ground water runs out / almost runs out in some localities every year. The situation is gradually worsening I guess.",boyohboyitsmytimeto," you people can have a massive protest for jallikatu but you cant get together to protest against water shortage? where are your so called film stars gods now? havent heard any of them saying anything about the water shortage, if you want to protest effectively get a massive crowd of people and shut of the water supply to chief ministers and his cabinet ministers homes or surround their homes\offices and dont let them come out for a few days Unfortunately you can't do anything. This should've been done a long time ago. Ever since Jayalalitha died, this state went into shambles. Only thing we could do is pray that 2015-like rains occur in Chennai so that our ground water fills up. iirc, our geography books in high school taught us about Rainwater harvesting and its successful implementation in Tamil Nadu. It said that TN has transformed itself from water deficit to water sufficient using rainwater harvesting. So how exactly did such a problem of water deficiency occur? The problem is most people think they are outside the system, The rainwater harvesting policy was implemented in 2001, but people find it easier to bribe officials during construction and then blame the govt for not doing anything. The Electorate does not hold its elected representative responsible when a lake/tank magically transforms into a high-rise.
This is why I don't think that the majority of Indian's even consider themselves to be living in a society, where we all are accountable for our actions.
We must come together to overcome religious/caste divisions to unite and take action. If tomorrow 1000's of citizens peacefully walk up to their MLA's, municipal corporators and demand actions along with constructive suggestions things can take shape. I understand that the situation is dire and things have to move quickly but this is all a keyboard warrior can offer. Tell your local babus that they will get 2 Crore bribe for each reservoir built. Job done. Is it possible to implement rainwater harvesting in already built houses and apartments? . if so the government should do it asap. If that's not possible then at least newly built homes should have rainwater harvesting. I can't see any immediate solution for this problem tbh. The problem is exacerbated by various factors:

1) Local body elections which were due in 2016 have not been held yet. There's just no1 who can be held accountable by people. This problem was evident during cyclone Gaja when people were struggling and hoping for someone for some kind of accountability. Unless we strengthen our local bodies we have no hope. Lakes and ponds will continue to get encroached, Cooum will continue to stink and the city will soon be uninhabitable. 

2) Don't think ruling party really cares about anything anymore (except for holding on to power till 2021). They know they are heading for defeat and so don't have good governance as priority. DMK is waiting for ADMK to implode. Unless we have good monsoon this year we are doomed. Yes, can start a water bucket challenge on social media.

Jus that there would be no water in the bucket. lol as long as your nepotist parties are in power, you can forget about anything being taken serious immediately. Protests, social media campaigns. Groups making policy suggestions. 

Pressuring elected legislature.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",12,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,1555360902.0,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",FrustratedOCIHopeful," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn’t lying, it’s worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

&#x200B;

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".   
an embassy is not your regular post office branches. the productivity level despite being in perpetual shortage of stuff is inspiring for all other government branches.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

Cheers.

[Also, hope this isn't the wrong place to ask this, but r/askIndia seems a bit dead and the other thread I found about this topic seemed more focused on South India.]

If you are interested in pre british india have a look at ""Rebel Sultans: The Deccan from Khilji to Shivaji"" . This is the history of west and south central India before British became a force. yes ramachandra guha is a great writer  
Plassey to partition by  Sekhar Bandyopadhyay and India's Struggle for Independence by Bipin chandra are a good books too . there are bit more scolaristic books but still a great read The Namesake is a beautifully written book. Jhumpa Lahiri.

AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,39,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,36,1543864935.0,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",ab370a1d," In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",26,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,1548078786.0,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn’t find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,55,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,1555627392.0,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",2019-04-19 04:13:12
AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,29,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,67,1533946806.0,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",PsychoPass1," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! 😁 Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There’s a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She’s just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don’t do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I’m sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

An alternate way of living. And it is saying that it's my current way of living which is delusional instead. To make things clear, I'm referring to illusion by the word delusional. 
I should give you a perspective. I feel I should run away from the current way of life because it is a lot of words and symbols. Like job, future, girlfriend, career, love from other people, wanting to become a writer, wanting to buy latest and most advanced mobile phone and TV etc. I feel like starting from the scratch and rejecting everything world has to offer. I know a few places where even food and living won't be problem. There's therefore this conflict I'm going through therefore.",HarHarGange," Buddy it's that phase of life where you gotta sit and revisit some recent decisions that may have led you to this situation, there is nothing more to it unless you let it get to you. Thanks for checking on yourself and talking about it.

Firstly **forgive** yourself if you think you have done something wrong and in case your social environment has led you to this situation then try and **forget** it. 

The forgive and forget part is crucial, after this just spend a day or two like you usually do and see if it still makes you feel delusional. 

Finally if you still feel delusional then the you gotta consult doctor which is for the best. Absolutely nothing wrong with taking care of your mental health, we often seem to ignore it and make it worse. This is called depression.  Yes, go visit a psychiatrist before it turns into full fledged psychosis. Please visit a psychiatrist and talk about this. That's the best way to get a professional opinion on whether there are any underlying issues.

Also remove any taboo that you may have associated with mental sickness. The mind, like the body can also get sick and there is nothing wrong with it. Dude, this is completely normal! I get these thoughts every morning... But things go normal after breakfast, and when I have to take public transport to office! You mean you’re going through adolescence? Let me get this straight.You realised that the world you live in is revolving around a few words and symbols.You feel that the performances are meaningless or Do you feel that the whole  thing is overwhelming?

I think there's more to it than you've presented. In any case, running away is usually a sub-optimal solution.Think critically, or get somebody who is an expert in critical thinking to help you unpack your idea - possibly a counselling psychologist. Fyki , being a sadhu is not a solution . Its a big scam. Just wondering you username Where is such a place? Like an ashram or some such?  What if you change your mind in the future? There will be no going back. I'd suggest being a part of this world while not consuming all of it if you so wish. Just collect enough resources to live comfortably.",2019-01-27 08:31:08
Reddiquette,"[serious] [reddiquette] [askindia] March End woes, questions regarding rent receipt submission and taxation and legalities.",6,b6uzbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b6uzbt/serious_reddiquette_askindia_march_end_woes/,0,1553879497.0,"Hello r/india! I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.

**Backstory:**

Concerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady ""F"", whose husband ""M"" holds an ""Irrevocable Power of Attorney"" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter ""D"" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.

Due to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar's office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F's PAN.

All rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D's account.

**Actual Issue:**

From April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to 'pay rounded amount' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.

Now, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he'll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M's HUF PAN as owner's PAN.

Coming to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing ""TDS would be cut"". I told him he's a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).

End on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to ""M"" instead of ""F"" as I had previously done.

Rent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.

**Important Note:**

I don't care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).
All I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.

**Questions:**

1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?
2. Submitting rent receipts for first time: Legal issues for forging M's signature (for actual rent paid as he would never give signature voluntarily)?
3. Given that actual registered agreement period was over after 11 months but I was actually staying there for 13 months more and paying electricity bills and rents (all online) prove I was still a resident at the flat?

Question 3 assumes that I get IT query after owner declares signatures forged, declines I was resident or paid rent for period after agreement.

Thanks to all for your time and help.

TLDR: Verbally extended rental agreement has no PAN as owner/attorney does not wish to provide it. Forging signature on receipts for actual rent paid online every time. Implications?",rakhsup92,,2019-03-29 22:41:37

Fiddling with the dipper during rush hour as if the cars ahead will suddenly dissolve into thin air is beyond irritating. 

 I always give slight honks when making a turn or overtaking or changing lanes and i don't mid other people doing this, what i do mind though is retards honking in heavy traffic as if that's gonna solve anything especially hate those modified loud horns which people add by themselves.

Reddiquette,[Reddiquette] Rant about quora,69,7h2uhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7h2uhv/reddiquette_rant_about_quora/,28,1512253133.0,"Let me begin by clearing why I use quora. While reddit is great for asking question on various communities, quora is the only place where I can get unironic answers for my questions related to various exams conducted in India. 


But what is up with these Indian quora users? Do they really think that giving a really long answer would make up for the lack of attention they received from the opposite gender in their school college. What is inhibiting them from giving a straight and concise answer to simple straight forward question. 


Now I know that there are quorans who wave around their degrees from IITs and IIMs, but truth be told, rarely I have seen an IIM grad irl who gives such long and lofty answer to anything. They keep it short and simple. The same cannot be said about IITians. Yes I know you worked hard to get where you are, but you don't have to rub it in on someone who doesn't care about your degree and is just here for clearing something up.

Coming back to the rant, does every answer need to be an essay on your life? Also, if I am asking an insightful/technical question of which I happen to know somethings  I am really interested in what I asked. I don't want the googled textbook definition  that you ripped off from a website to sound smart and I certainly don't need all the background information on the topic. For example, I recently came across a question asking if Arnab Goswami is a liberal or conservative. Now this randi quoran gave a 200 word explanation on what it means to be a liberal and a conservative. And then went on to the function of the government. In the final sentence was his answer. THE  ANSWER NEEDED WAS JUST ONE SENTENCE and he wrote 500 word essay. 


Also, the whole of quora is the r/askreddit sub. All the question that get answered are the questions which have nothing insightful.  I remember asking a question about the Rakhine situation, and ended up getting answers from an extremely xenophobic dude, who ranted how all bangladeshis should be killed who come to India. I mean dude, can you even read. I just asked why Myanmar refused to accept Rohingya as it's residents.


Also, what is up with these teenagers giving out life lessons?  They are 18 ffs. They have barely even experienced it. 

Tl:dr; Rants of a madman on quora users. I know there are subreddits such as r/indianpeoplequora and r/rant , however I chose this subreddit since the people at r/rant won't get what I am on about and it isn't exacty r/indianpeoplequora material.",reallyneedafriend," Just use it for your competitive exam related queries and don't use it for anything else. I have facebook just to send some messages or attachments incase whatsapp does not work, don't use it otherwise. 

Edit: Adding to what I said, no site is 100% useful, reddit has lots of shit floating around (in fact I would say majority of reddit is absolute shithole) but we only visit the good parts. Its true for most things in life, use the parts which are useful to you, don't use the rest.  Here's how I use quora, if I have a question I google it. If a quora link comes up as a search result then read answers otherwise don't go to quora.  Mate you have to block like, every single Indian author on Quora along with “India” topic. This is the only way to reduce shit from coming up on your news feed. It took me few hours but it was worth the effort.  on quora, you will notice young people are giving life lessons, advices, experiences.......(which you normally expect from elders)

I' be like ""itna experience laatein kahaan se yeh bachhe""
 Not to mention when indian sapios try to write sarcastic answers when somebody    asks questions about how they are in depression and feeling suicidal. Ah. Nice rant. Let me tell you a story of when I was in IIT Kharagpur 2 years back. ..... r/indianpeoplequora [deleted] a girl once told me that she is cheif on some topic on quora . i have stoppedtalking to her since The psyche of Indians is very limited and this is the fault of our education. I left Quora because of these sapiosexual types increasing in number. I get that you can be sometimes proud of your college or whatever, but to make it as an identity throughout your life is limiting yourself as getting into IITs becomes your sole highest achievement of your life.

This is exactly reflected in Quora and other sites.

Although, I don't want to stereotype every Quora Indian. There are some people who have lived their substantial adult working life in the USA or some other country and still give biased answers against Muslims or minorities of the country they live in etc. This is what is really disheartening. 1.) Qualifications are the only thing most Indians can boast about to compensate for small penis/ovaries or a lack of a non-curated life brought to you by their parents. 

2.) Check the answer, if it has too many links. Then it's just someone trying to get the tiny link juice their SEO achieves from Quora. If that's the case Harsh Agarwal's ShoutMeLoud army at work.
 I found it similar to what you describe however it takes time to correct your feed.

1. Downvote or report every answer you dont think is good enough. Give reasons for reporting. I found out after a few days of downvoting my content changed dramatically.
Indians overtake your feed if you dont downvote or mute them.

2. Follow different authors or accounts. Most Indian authors write similar and it gets boring very quickly.

3. Its changing to a author-centric site as someone mentioned to a collection of people's experiences. If you like reading about them give it a try. I recently followed a guy who used to work in Russian propoganda ministry. Its fascinating to see his writing.

Quora is now mostly a site for people to share their experiences. Factual answers pop up very less. If you like such content, give it a try. Horny saapio virgins trying hard to get into someone's pants. [deleted] Use the mute button liberally.  Isn't your rant a long essay? ",2017-12-03 03:48:53

Reddiquette,[Np] Reddiquette. You Should Know : The largest combined arms operation after WW2 that resulted in the largest number of prisoners gained after WW2. India's brilliant victory in the 1971 war.,162,2dbsis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2dbsis/np_reddiquette_you_should_know_the_largest/,107,1407872937.0,"The Indian victory against Pakistan in 1971 was one of the greatest examples of operational art and the largest combined arms operation after World War 2. It was a masterpiece of Political objective, Strategic vision, operational planning and tactical execution.


It is important to understand why it was seen as such a great victory. Warfare is usually divided into Positional attrition warfare (think World War 1, Iran-Iraq war or even the India-China war / India-Pakistan war of 1965) or maneuver driven situational warfare. The concept of maneuver warfare was propounded (at around the same time) by various European warfare experts, B.H.Liddel Hart (England) and Mikail Tucahavesky (shot dead by Stalin, and one of THE finest military minds the world has ever seen) was it’s greatest exponent. His theory was, 


Attack on a broad front > use air superiority and arty to make holes in the enemy line > Use this penetration to feed in highly mobile troops who would use maneuver to keep the enemy off balance. The Positional warfare suggests that you can win a war only by crushing the enemies main point of defense (mostly frontally – the British were a firm believer in this theory) while indirect / maneuver warfare suggests that you avoid the strong points, and hit the vulnerable rear of the enemy, keep him off balance, deny him his CCI structure and win the war by using terrain and encirclement (read up on Cannae or Kharkov / Smolensk for examples of encirclement warfare) .


India which had favoured the first theory in all it’s wars till then used the second theory to great effect.


**The Planning:**


In March 1971, Indira Gandhi came back to power with a resounding mandate, and was faced with an immediate crisis! The Bangladeshi refugee problem. A genocide in East Pakistan (estimated deaths vary from 3 million to 4 million) was pushing a massive amount of refugees into India. Her cabinet (especially Defence minister Jagjivan Ram) favoured immediate invasion to settle this crisis and to discuss this, she summoned the CoAS – Sam ‘Bahadur’ Manekshaw. In a very interesting and stormy meeting, she told him to prepare for an invasion of East Pakistan.  Sam Bahadur point blank refused to entertain this and offered to resign straight away. Indira who was used to getting her way, did not like this resistance but asked her advisors to leave the room and had Manekshaw speak his mind freely. He laid down three reasons why he preferred an invasion in the closing months of the year. In this he was going against both Jagjivan Ram and Indira Gandhi  and he was aware of this, but he refused to be a party to a botched up invasion.


•	The Passes with China would be closed because of snow, making it difficult for the Chinese to intervene. In June (when Indira was asking him to invade) the passes would be clear and would need a diversion of efforts to defend these.

•	Monsoon (in this he was proven very right) and the resulting quagmire. The Russian word for it was called “Raptistuta” and means a sea of mud! Mud is the worst enemy for movement (even hard snow can be managed) as it stalls movement to a very low speed. Monsoon would also mean rivers would be in spate so bridging & fording them would be eminently more challenging. August that year saw the worst tropical storm on record till date. It inundated whole parts of Bangladesh and killed half a million Bangladeshi’s.

•	The last was building up a strong and valid cassus belli (cause for war). If India was seen as the aggressor, sanctions would cripple an already crippled economy. It needed to make a case for itself. In the mean time it could use the Bangladeshi govt in exile (based in Calcutta) and the newly created Mutki Bahini to drum up support for itself.

Indira Gandhi agreed to his conditions and set about on a whirlwind tour of diplomacy. She went to Moscow, US, UK & France. She told the governments there that the situation was untenable, but Pakistan was a strong member of the SEATO and CENTO so the western democracies (in a blatant case of hypocrisy) stood by idly while a massive genocide was being perpetrated. Only the USSR recognized the problem, and shipped arms & ammunitions to India to build up her stockpile. India also signed a 20 year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance (this was to prevent any actions by the NATO / US / China)


Mankeshaw then went to work. He created a JIC (IB+RAW+Military intelligence) and a Joint Planning Command (India did not and still does not have a Combined Chief of Staffs like other nations do) to bring the civilians, army, navy and airforce together in the planning. Overall command was given to Lt Gen J.S.Arora who was CiC of the Eastern Command.


**Order Of Battle**


The OOB was as follows, Eastern Command > 3 Army Corps (2nd, 33rd and 4th) > 5 Infantry divisions + 2 Mountain that were on defensive mode. Attached to the infantry divs we had the equivalent of 1 armored division (broken up into regiments). 
Pakistan had roughly 3 Infantry divs and 2 divisions worth of paramilitary and a brigade of armour.


The odds were roughly 2:1 favouring India (conventionally 4:1 was recommended, 3:1 was the bare minimum). In the air India had total supremacy in the east(which was vital) and marginal superiority in the west.


The Mukti Bahini had roughly 60,000 numbers of irregulars. They played the exact same role the French partisans played in WW2 after Normandy. During the war, the Mukti Bahini contributed to the speed of advance of the Indians by providing ready labor and intelligence on the deployment of Pakistani forces. The MB sabotaged Pakistani lines of communication, they struck at weak points (in the rear) with brigade sized forces and caused the Pakistani defence to spread itself thin.


**The Indian Plan**

It was multi layered in it’s approach. Attack in depth to force the Pakistanis to thin themselves out, Cutoff river crossings (to prevent reinforcements and retreat from reaching the Pakistani troops) and finally capture the two key ports in Bangladesh. 

There was one major element of genius provided by J.S.Arora. He changed the Schwerpunkt from the logical south to the more difficult east. The South had it’s base in Bengal, had access to major railway lines and depots and Lt Gen Niazi (Pakistani commander) anticipated the main focus (Schwerpunkt) to be in this sector and aligned his defences accordingly. The East had everything going against it. The main base was inn Tripura, supply / logistics chains had immense difficulties but it was also the closest route to Dhaka. 

J.S Arora allocated the strongest force to the East and the weakest force to the South (the exact opposite of the Pakistani defensive alignment). This has it’s roots in classical warfare including WW2 and the battle of Cannae (which was positional warfare for it’s time). Operation Barbarossa focused it’s Schwerpunkt in the Centre and North while Stavka (Soviet high command aka Stalin) anticipated the key thrust in the South. The German approach to indirect warfare surprised the Russians and caused them a massive loss in men, space and equipment.


**The Pakistani Plan**

Counter offensive in the West and a tiered defense in the East using river lines and cities as strong points (very similar in concept to the Russian defense in WW2 – use river lines and force attritional warfare on the invader. Retreat to city holdfasts and engage troops in urban warfare. Hold out and delay the offensive till such time the UN forced a cease fire (like it had done in the Israeli wars). 

In Bangladesh, Niazi proposed retreating to just outside Dhaka and holding a region around Dhaka (using river lines and Dhaka as a central pivot). The Pakistani establishment rejected this. Once again we have parallels in World War 2. Poland had the option to withdraw it’s forces to the Vistula line, use Warsaw as a pivot and defend a limited area, both these sound ideas were rejected because…”Nationalism”! Not one inch of land would be surrendered etc etc. Niazi went for (as the Indian side had hoped) the WW2 Russian strategy of defending some fortified towns (or as Hitler called them – Festungs) and river lines (bridges). 

The idea was to cut down on the Indian freedom of movement by forcing them to engage in urban warfare. They did make a fatal flaw in their planning. They assumed that India would fight 10 different “Stalingrads”, and never reach Dhaka so they never allocated troops to defend Dhaka (the same mistake Hitler made in WW2 with respect to the defence of Berlin)


**The War**

•	3rd December, Operation Chingis goes in. Pakistan launches a preemptive strike on Indian airfields (in the West). The IAF fights a holding campaign before launching a massive bombardment operation the next morning. In the East, elements of 33 Corps go into action, their objective is to take a vital railway junction. Hilli however was one of the first echelons of Pakistan’s defenses and was very well prepared and supplied. The battle quickly became a battle of attritional warfare, however 340 Brigade spotted an opening in the flank and in a very German Blitzkrieg type of operation, formed combat groups (on the spot) of tanks and infantry and exploited the gap, and these combat groups raced to the river lines that Pakistan had intended to use as defensive strongpoints. Faced with Indians in the rear and forward of them, the resistance quickly collapsed.


•	In the South, using maneuver warfare (as against to positional warfare used by 33 Corp) 2 Corps makes rapid progress, 2 Corps launches a pincer attack using two infantry divisions to envelop Pakistani defences. They keep pushing on towards their target without giving the defenders time to rest and redraw their defensive lines. 2 Corps used the classic maneuver tactics used by Germany in WW2, Israel in the Sinai. They ignored strong points while rushing the rear of the enemy lines (the OMG of Russian doctrine came into play). The infantry pushed on into Pakistani frontline positions who attempted to withdraw to prepared lines only to find them occupied by Indian troops. Defense spectacularly collapsed in this sector. 

•	In the East, 4 Corps (the largest Indian grouping with 3 divisions) and a bold leader pretty much repeated what 2 Corps did. The CO (Lt Gen Sagat Singh) used the Russian concept of Maskirovka and set up a feint attack towards Chittagong, this drew Pakistani defenders (already facing 3:1 odds) to Chittagong weakening their centre. Here we come across a massive feat of arms – Airlifting of 2 entire combat equipped brigades. Rather than contest the Meghna river bridges, Singh sidestepped the exceedingly strong Pakistani defences by getting 2 brigades airlifted and dropped across the river (right into Pakistani lines). The eastern sector was decided as the Schwerpunkt (the focus point of the offensive) and it showed. The Indian troops rapidly outflanked prepared Pakistani positions, artillery was used to bombard these pockets into submission, the IAF flew CAS (Combat Air Support) / Interdiction missions all of which freed the infantry and armour to keep moving. This was classic Blitzkrieg minus only the Stuka sirens. 


The Pakistani forces were in headlong retreat towards Dhaka and this posed a big problem. If they gained the Dhaka region, they could organize a very stubborn defense which would cost 1000’s of Indian lives to capture. To prevent this, 2 Para was dropped BEHIND enemy lines into the region of Tangail. They were very less in number, and if the Pakistanis had grouped up and attempted to fight their way through, 4 Para could have been decimated, but thanks to the Indian Blitzkrieg tactic, the Pakistani C&C set up was decimated and they could not mount a cohesive response. After the drop, the demoralization (and destruction) of organized resistance was complete.


**Psycops**


The Pakistani resistance still numbered in the 1,00,000 and pockets could take a lot of Indian lives to break, so India went on a pysop campaign. Pakistani wirless networks were spammed with “surrender and live” messages (India had cracked the cipher used in East Pakistan before the war itself), Sam Bahadur himself went on air and told Pakistanis that if they surrendered they would be treated honourably, and this cracked any vestige of resistance. Pakistani soldiers began surrendering to the Indian army in droves. Niazi signed the instrument of surrender (a bitter man) on 16th December and went into captivity, along with him 91,000 Pakistani troops also went into captivity.

Even back then, we were spammers.

Great read, though. /r/depthhub Thanks for this awesome post!. I want to know more about Warfare, can you suggest me some books that i can read ? 
  Don't 4get the brilliant operations Trident and Python of the Navy. V crippled the enemy and took no casualties in both operation.  Excellent post! Sam Manekshaw, JFR Jacob, PC Lal... the armed forces were exceptionally well led in that war!

You should start a blog. Reach a wider audience.  Pakistan got spanked in this war, no other way to put it. But aside from the loss of life, I'm glad we lost. Bangladesh should never have been part of Pakistan in the first place, and our leaders were doing them no favors. I don't know how true it is, but a lot of people say that during the war, General Yahya Khan was busy drinking and womanizing.  Thanks for the post. I was really looking forward to read this post once I reach home after work. Why the hell is this stuff not taught in schools. According to our text books we have absolutely no history after gaining independence.

You could have made this post on Independence day. Now you must post another one.  What? No reference to Heinz Guderian in maneuver warfare?! Poda!

But great post though! Interesting read, thanks for this. You should add some sources for further reading.

I read about [Sam Manekshaw](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Manekshaw) yesterday, extraordinary individual with a very decorated history. He even served against imperial Japan in WW2. The Soviet Union was also critical to this victory.  Nixon had sent the 7th Fleet into the Bay of Bengal on day 2 to shut down the Indian offensive via aerial and naval bombardment, but the USSR sent a nuclear sub to tail them, implicitly threatening nuclear war should Nixon do so. Gee thnx OP , not only did you mesmerize me with your narration, you have now I have all these books I want to read !

but seriously, thank you , this was brilliant. I saw a brilliant movie 1971, damn the ending still tears me up. What a brilliant actor Manoj Bajpayee is. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKHd6eZ4TLQ Since a number of people over here are asking for further reads, I would recommend this excellent book - ['The Blood Telegram'](http://www.amazon.com/The-Blood-Telegram-Kissinger-Forgotten/dp/0307700208), less from the Indian perspective, and more of Nixon's phobia towards India, and the resulting policies. I have somewhere read that one of the long term mistakes India made during the war was not capturing Pak/ Kashmir territory when they had the chance (as spoils of war) and instead retreating back to pre war positions, this squandered our effort and gains in the long term Okay I have a mildly irrelevant question: weren't Sam Manekshaw and Cariappa Field Marshals at the same time?  Thank you for this excellent analysis. [A life lived such - Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmPmm7QeIE) While I knew that the 71 war had created one of the largest number of PoWs, the detailed post really gave a lot of insights about the actions on ground. Thanks! Thanks a lot for this. I am very poor when it comes to history like this. Could you hyper link your sources? That way I can find related stuff on the internet. Thanks again. This is the kind of post I want to see in r/India. I love you guys. You should read Col. [David Glantz](http://www.great-victory1945.ru/glantz_3.htm) books/articles on WW2 conflict between USSR and German/Axis powers.

More recently [air cavalry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_assault) concept from Vietnam War and [Air-Land](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirLand_Battle) and [Air-Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirSea_Battle) battle doctrine of US 

Some of your analogies to WW2 Germany and USSR could be more nuanced. While principles of maneuver warfare have been around and employed, there is a sea change between nazi doctrine (which was an amorphous collections of principles, often aiming to create a Kesselschlact (battle cauldron) and identifying the SchwerPunkt (focal point of attack) and Soviet combined arms doctrine. These also evolved over time, example [the first battle of smolensk was a disaster for Soviets, as Stalin insisted that they not retreat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Smolensk_\(1941\)) 

1971 Also saw one place in the east where the Indian army had a heavy slog of it with a more or less direct assault against a tenacious Pakistani commander who had taken advantage of local terrain (ditches etc)  . Will try to locate the reference from Bharat Rakshak or wiki. 

Pakistan strategy that defence of the east ""lies in the west"" and reliance on foreign support was shattered by the speed and preparedness of the Indian assault in the east, able diplomacy by India, local support by Mukti Bahini, and sufficient counterblow in the west to create a stalemate there. You might want to make more of a point of it.

One very minor mistake in a good post is the reference to Hitler's mistake in not manning the city of Berlin. This is an underappreciation of the situation at the end of the war and the local geography/times. The battle of berlin was conducted at natural fortification just outside and was one of the bloodiest and desperate battles of WW2. 

Also of note - The Burma campaign that turned back the japanese army has been cited as one of the largest defeats of the Japanese army ever. (guadalacanal was comparable, but viewed as less strategic and including japanese navy). The battle of Imphal and Kohima are under-rated, as is the achievement of the Chindits. Truly, this is the forgotten war. Perhaps partly because it was a British Indian army with british commanders, partly because the Japanese were at the end of their supply lines, partly because Bose was on the other side.  

The battle of [Keren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Keren) (a predecessor of Monte Cassino and Tiger Hill) , and other british indian exploits too warrant mentioning.

Neverthless the 1971 war was extremely notable, for all the reasons you mention and more. Great research but couple of points:

* The Maneckshaw offering to resign thing seems blown out of proportion. No one would seriously suggest attacking rainy flood-prone land in the monsoon. Since time immemorial monsoon has been off season for wars in India.

* All your references are by Indian writers who were actors in the war. ""Major element of genius provided by J.S. Arora"" and written about by J.S. Arora, am I right. Every decision victors make in a war becomes one of genius especially when victors write it. You should read some neutral reports. 

* I believe ""Slender was the Thread"" is about the 47-48 war and does not count here. INDIA IS DA BEST. SO PROUD OF MY CUNTRY.",2014-08-13 01:18:57
Reddiquette,Serious Question to AAP supporters. [Reddiquette],48,2chvdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2chvdi/serious_question_to_aap_supporters_reddiquette/,223,1407095419.0,"Do you folks support AK or AAP and what it stands for? If tomorrow in a hypothetical world, the top 4 in AAP get removed in an intra party coup, would you still support AAP?

Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental? 

",DaManmohansingh," I was a big AAP supporter and supported the idea behind it. Almost everything AK did pre-Delhi elections was in line with the idea. He then tried to become a politician. Something he is not good at. Congress dragged him to their level and beat him at it.

The coalition with Congress was his political hara-kiri. I support AAP in general, although I think AK is the main driving force in the party. I would still support them if the top 4 get removed, because I think they believe in something, and if they follow the same policies, I am fine with it. Although, I think AK is the reason they draw such crowds, he is pretty good at what he does.

Although I may disagree with some of their policies such as the anti-nuclear power stand. Also the unnecessary support for Gaza.

I still think they are the best thing to have happened to Indian politics. Being clean and corruption free is the most important thing, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, that is not the case in India. The corrupt and the thugs are rewarded, while the nice guys are sidelined. AAP is really necessary in Indian politics, more to keep the main parties in check.

AAP is the only party in support of bringing accountability for political parties. Both BJP and congress will never support RTI for political parties.

AAP is the only party which seriously opposes criminality in politics. You can see the hypocrisy in both BJP and congress where they provide lip service but when its their turn to implement it, they'll say its just ""politics"".

So as long as AK/AAP stand for cleaning up politics and jail the corrupt politicians, I will support them. We need AAP.

This is how electoral discourse happens in India now :

> INC: Hey BJP, You did X. That is bad.

> BJP: But INC, you did Y. Which is worse.

At the end, nothing gets done about X or Y. The two parties replace talking about the issues & instead talk about which 1 is holier.

AAP, with small history, can break this cycle. I will support anyone which brings the bill of swaraj.  As for Ak and just modi..  I some how trust them both to take a decision for the nation.  I didn't have that feeling for Congress or shiv sena or any other party. 

Some how after modi is done,  I don't trust anyone.. 

Ak has had for long been against the government and now he is trying to be the government to change it.  

If the 49 days was any indication then I will for a thousand times donate and trust them with my vote  [deleted] >Or do you support AK, and AAP is incidental?

It's the other way around. If AAP had some other leader I would still support. However, AK turns out to be quite an able administrator, apart from a few things like showbaazi and stuff. Having known his history and achievements, I can assuredly put my faith in him to do what he believes in. 

Transparency in functioning, anti-corruption stance, RTI, right to recall are all the principles that I strongly subscribe to and there I am not aware of a single political party that stands for them other than AAP. It's really the lack (or even the presence) of a non-shady political party that makes my support for AAP stronger.  

And as long as the core principles of AAP remain the same, any fallouts in the leadership is not gonna affect my support. I personally support the founding principles of AAP, to be a force to end corruption and bring accountability to government functioning.  I also think that both BJP and Congress are corrupt (to varying degrees), and don't have any incentive to end corruption.

I think a party like AAP even if they don't win a majority can be a voice of reason within the parliament.

So regarding your first query, I will keep supporting AAP through donations because they are my only source of hope in this muddled democracy.

As far as AK is concerned, I don't think he is a power-hungry maniac as some people tend to believe. They did make some mistakes like resigning from the Delhi government and trying to fight across India in general elections.

He basically tried to expand too fast, without having a robust fundamental structure in place. He failed. Many people saw this as an excellent opportunity to hit him when he is down. Obviously, pissing off the media and industrialists like Mukesh Ambani did little good. They went after him when they saw the opportunity post-elections.

I strongly believe he has the best interests of the country in mind. I also believe is a man of high integrity. He is interlinked with the AAP movement, and there is no separating the two.

So yes, I will keep supporting AK as well.
 yes i will still support AAP if it is lead by a person of clean image.I see only changing the current political scenario as respite from my troubles.the JLB,swaraj and their transparency regarding funds is good. TBH I don't support AAP. I just don't think they deserve much of the hate they get based on no facts. So to clear a few things:

1. AAP is no more a Congress B-Team than BJP
2. AAP is not full of Kashmir separatists
3. AAP is not a Maoist party

I have no idea how people believe all this crap. [deleted] [deleted] I support Both AAP and AK. both go hand in hand. Question is asked to create a distinction between AK and AAP. I hope you are not Arnab Goswami. 
 [Reddiquette] does nothing, it should be [R]

And with the Politics tag, you cannot have a [R] enforced thread, unless something changed I will always support AK.

I request all to **plzzzz** read this http://www.rmaf.org.ph/newrmaf/main/awardees/awardee/biography/141 So, is the person bigger or the idea? I support both (and I can't digest the fact that people are sticking to the traditional corrupt, communal parties). AK is not extremely intelligent (and may say stupid things from time to time), but his heart is at right place and he did things consistent with the principles of AAP (except the Delhi house thingy, which is a minor infraction). AAP does not matter . Its the idea they bring that matters. 

THe IDEA is integrity , accountability and 0 tolerance to corruption.  

I see humility to accept their mistake publicly and change. 

I see their stand for the community. 

And I also see all the behind the door strategies to subdue them. 

India could be a golden bird again and people would line up to migrate to india rather that other way around THIS IDEA came into existence. 
 I loved the idea, the movement and the support. I joined rallies, shouted slogans and actually celebrated when they won Delhi.

Then congress happened. And then 49 days. 

Lost faith.  To be honest, i don't know what they stand for anymore. They messed up big time after forming the government in Delhi. Some of their decisions regarding power and water supply were good but the weird agitation and antics (of Somnath Bharti and few others) seemed like they were trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.
Before the Delhi elections, my dad was invited to one of their meetings. He said most of the people there were former BJP and Congress members. I just think AAP and AK both are not mature enough to rule. I can be wrong, but this was my personal feeling while voting in 2014 Lok Sabha.  I imagine if anything removal of Kejriwal, Salim Yadav, Bhushan, Sisodia, Ashutosh etc. would be a bonus.

But seriously speaking, even with these faces gone, what exactly does AAP represent? Anti-corruption? Okay, but what are their policies. A repeated subject of criticism is that their members come from all idealogical backgrounds from left to right(or, from Medha Patkar to Meera Sanyal) and as a party they have very few clearly defined policies and viewpoints.

Also their frequent Muslim appeasement, sometimes going to ridiculous levels(eg. Holding concerts and candlelight vigils for Gaza when the public is more concerned with Saharanpur and other domestic issues) really gets on many voters' nerves. Similarly the fuss they made over Batla House and 'open letter to Muslims' last year was a turn-off for many voters. I'd be more willing to support them if the top 4 got removed. There are probably a lot of decent people who are working for AAP and they are ones who should be running the party, not attention whores like AK. ",2014-08-04 01:20:19

Maybe they're doing work, but its not the media anymore.

Again, not a hater - I support Modi's economic vision.",ramukakaforever," The fact that you had to preface a statement with ""Not a hater"".... It is ongoing but at a very slow pace. I see a few public toilets in the Mumbai Hyderabad high way within 2km stretch which was surprising. But it's not happening as fast as it should. The UPA had a similar Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan program, which was a failure. [CAG even found alarming discrepancies in fund allocation and its misuse and also a clear failure in the implementation of the sanitation program.] (http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-nirmal-bharat-abhiyan-total-failure-cag-2153561)

Swachh Bharat, in all likelihood, is going the same way. Atleast to me, there is no visible outcome or change.

PS: Why do you have to keep justifying that you are not a hater, (not once but twice)? Ask your question boldly. If someone accuses you of something you are not, just ignore. No need to be this defensive that too upfront. What happened? 
People still blaming government for not doing thier job and continue to litter. 

One time, one of my uncle was driving me around in Delhi NCR. He was surprised to see that I kept my trash in my hand for hours until I found a trash can to throw it. When I asked the reason, he said I would have thrown it out from the window long time ago. He even told other people about it.

http://www.dnaindia.com/topic/swachh-bharat-mission

There are other updates too, just Google it. You are paying another tax now, that's what happened :) what else were you expecting :) In my town Belgaum Karnataka 

All pan shops have been given a dustbin to put outside their shop. 

Bus stand got cleaned. Railway station is clean. But the city is still dirty as usual. But I don't blame that on govt they clean dustbins and open dustbins daily. But a lot of opeople who still open gutka packet put it in mouth and throw the cover on the floor while standing next to a dustbin. They have also started a new drive for smokers they are giving metal pots for cigarette buds and told pan shops to enforce it some have some havnt Did you not see advertisements with Anupam Kher today? I don't have a clear idea about the cess. How does it work?

The funds from the cess go to Swacch Bharat Abhiyan; that much is clear.

So, how does a central government program seek to influence the efficiency of waste disposal and management at panchayat level and municipality level?

Is Swacch Bharat a cleanliness program or an awareness program about cleanliness? Swacch Bharat Cess is still there, I think. The campaigning is there no more, I think. Imho large ambitious culture changing government programs always fail. From 'big leap' to Jimmy Carter's attempt to reduce fossil fuel dependence they havr always always failed. 

Swachh Bharat can work as a branding exercise for several different infra improvement projects but I can't see how it will really bring any changes beyond that.  They are working not talking.  I don't know about anyone else, but where I live, this ""Swacch Bharat"" thing has failed miserably, completely.

The only thing that has been cleaned is the mayor's house, that retarded goon likes to litter his own place and then take photos of himself holding a mop. And then once his home is cleaned, the retard keeps claiming it as a remarkable achievement and first step to Swacch Bharat. Checking on this thread after 15 hours: the consensus seems that we should not litter. 
--
I still can't figure out the point of allocating crores when there's no unique problem solving for India's trash problem / our tendency to litter. more tax & seasonal topic for selfies/tweets.

Did you expect more than that ? Still people are loitering the spaces as before. Though Modi did a good job of bringing swacch bharat campaign he should have stopped the campaign with educating people to be clean and aware of cleanliness of their surroundings. Instead he started to impose swacch bharat cess which is not a good thing to do. Publicity should be given for swach bharat no doubt in that, but taxing people in name of swach bharat not good.

Fuck IITJEE
 FIITJEE is the most fucked up institute. Their math books start with equations. Like wtf. They know how to make simple things tough. They produce top rankers only because of large enrollment numbers and a handful of south Delhi teachers. I remember last time they referred 'Ram Rajya'.
Edit: I forgot about their mentions in Paradise papers. And yes these Institute do not teach science. Science is not sitting in a room and solving questions for two long year.

End of the day they will still teach science only Its a private company, it can do what it wants, right? People can just choose not to go there. The ad is deplorable. But Fiitjee is way better than narayana and chaitanya. Atleast where I studied. We live in a 1.3 billion society where 50% of the population is under 25. Blame the competition and lack of resources to educate the students. Peer pressure just adds depression into this primordial soup. 

When I studied in fiitjee (did not clear iitjee but got into a well known college) . There were no extra classes and we were taught Just the subject and given phase books. (8 phases in 2 years). You get into a good college if by yourself are motivated to study harder. Peer pressure kept us on our toes. Their material is good. More importantly, I learned to practice self-discipline. Something that was very useful when I entered college. I saw so many burned out people in IIT tanking their GPA from other  pre-university institutes.  Dude every iit jee Institute is like that all are fuckin pricks and sometimes even teachers are racists  Kalyug isn't an *idea*, it's a cosmological time-frame described in the Vedic literatures.

[Science & Technology],6,5jscfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,3,1482462289.0,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

Sad that the JP Nadda who got CVO AIIMS removed for investigating corruption at AIIMS is rewarded by the the Prime Minister. 

Does Arnab Goswami and his chums have the balls to question this? If this is not compromise, then I don't know what is. What is the point of majority if you still reward corrupt assholes.

This is why BJP supporters, the moderate centrists (swing vote), need to start being more vocal critics of poor govt. decisions. Some very questionable souls have crept into the Cabinet and people are so consumed by the Modi hype, that they don't bother to question. I am more sad than happy with this. Harshwardhan gone to other ministry, good, but which ministry : Science..now I am in doubt if he will start working on ""Indian Science"". And who has replaced him ? Nadda, controversial figure in all Harshwardhan-AIIMS controversy.

Policy & Economy,We really need to talk about Flairs.,103,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,1494883276.0,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-16 02:51:16

Psychology and then I can practice counselling and earn decent. 

Or 

Use MBA... do some financial planning...  

Please suggest other such options. 

*end of edit*

27M, single. 
 B. Tech (SRM, Chennai), MBA (BIM, Trichy) -> once among top 25 MBA institutes in the country. 

Working with an international bank.. about 11LPA salary. 

Savings would be about 5-6L. 

I just want to quit corporate world. I hate everything there. I feel I don't fit in there. 

Also have mental health issues diagnosed with Borderline, depression and a few others. Under therapy.. but it's long term. 
Have tinnitus ... Which kind of keeps me irritated a lot. 


I really want to quit everything.. go on a solo trip all over India... Just be by myself... And read.. completed first year MA philosophy, have over 100 books that I am yet to read.. want to read more... Both fiction as well as academic. Intrested in fields like history, philosophy, economy, public policy, psychology etc. 

May be write about things I learn.. 

But I need money too.. 
Let's say I rely on my parents for feeding me... And we have house so rental income can give me 3x food. 

But I need to make some money.
For starters therapy needs money. 
Travel will need money.. at least some money. 

I am trying to paint.. And that needs money. 

How do I make money?

Was thinking of doing B Sc Psychology and M Sc etc and getting into practice. So I can handle counseling sessions... 
That could a source of income. 


I don't know how much it will help in India... What else can I do?! 

With Borderline it's really getting difficult with relationshipz.. I don't think am ready for a relationship and I am not doing to get married with so much instability in my life...  Let's just think about me a person. 

I want to earn something at my pace to meet my needs. What are my options. 

Am MBA in finance, was also thinking of becoming a fee only financial advisor (aasan ideas for weaken FB group..) I actually do financial advice etc for friends and colleagues. 

Am not dumb.. I have cleared CAT.. I can teach kids for that.. take tuition... 

Am really confused :( what should I do? 

I hate everything... 

Sorry for the rant",sum1spcl," Well you sound like you desperately need a vacation to get your head sorted. Try to take 2 weeks off before quitting to come up with atleast a small plan to see what you want to do? That’s the only suggestion that I can give. So, I'll tell you how it all works out. 
I am no MBA neither am I some IIT. But I quit my decent paying job, moved back home first and eventually phased out of my job.

I just get about 10k coz in my free time I help dad manage some shit.

I was actively working on starting something of my own been about 40 months and nothing has yet worked out. I read a lot but that too has fizzled out coz now I am bored of books or frustrated in general and now I am more focused to getting back to earning.

I want to travel but that hasn't worked great 10k a month is insufficient for the entire month. 
So I went for a trek to Utharakhand. I paid 4500 in flight tickets to Delhi, train was about 900 I guess and 3500 for the trip. Stay was with friends and food was taken care. So saved there.

I planned a Hampi trip, it's supposed to be a cheap vacation from the place I live. But then j have other important expenses, like my health Insurance. I didn't have it until last year and then I got admitted into a hospital for 3 days and ended up paying more than a lakh.

My mom's root canal cost me 12k, You'll have to ensure your teeth are proper. Those buggers are a money sink.

You getting the idea?

Assuming you living in your home town. Now let's see you'll have friends and they'll surely want you to chill with them, they will be earning - once in a while you will have to go out with them, obviously don't want to end up alone coz you pinch money. One outing will set you back about 2k if you drink in my city. 

These are expenses and lifestyle you don't imagine and I considered it easy.

Do not. You have expenses, you have bills. You need a good passive income to sail you through. 
Again it'll be a call you'll have to take, lifestyle same rakhna hai ya scale down karna hai. 

For a similar lifestyle - I need about 15k a month to survive. But this is no savings. This is bills, travel and basic comfort.

Oh ya, your parents are getting old, so those expenses are something you need to keep in mind too. Even if they have saved some for themselves, as an Indian I am assuming, you'll be there and take responsibility.

What's the trade you need to make and how far can you go with a discipline? > DAE want to not work in a soul sucking job and just chill out and do things you enjoy?

That's what 90% of humanity dreams of bro Don't quit without a plan.

The least you can do is calculate how far your savings will last you, should you quit. After that, make a detailed plan on how to stretch your savings. Finally, as someone else commented, try picking up some freelance work on the internet or IRL to set up a network/fallback. If you can't find freelance work, it probably means you'll have to live solely on your savings...

Oh, and be absolutely sure that you can land a job again after a sabbatical - most industries choose to hire young 'uns because they are cheap and abundant. So, pretty soon you might find yourself too old or too expensive or both. You may not want to go back to a job but if things don't go right, you might just need to, so make sure that avenue remains open.

Source: Currently on a sabbatical. This is how I did it. I did it out of the blue in 2006. I just wanted to do my own thing. Had no idea what to do. I can identify with OP.  Hated corporate life, the politics, fake courtesy, blame games and shit..

Probably I am not fit for a corporate setup

Did leave my IT job a year ago to get a career change and now here I am seriously contemplating ways to kill myself..Unfortunately, you need to be lucky to die early

I hope you don't face the same if you decide to take the leap.. Job is not something you are supposed to enjoy. That's why you get paid for doing it. If it was something you enjoyed, you would be paying to do it. You do your job from Monday to Friday, make money & then use that money to pursue your hobbies (read/write/travel) during weekends, holidays and vacations. 

There is a lot of stuff between like & hate. So try to get a job you don't hate (you don't necessarily need to love it) & use the money to pursue your hobbies. You should generate some passive income, start an online business. Selling products on Amazon. If you can do an investment of 50k and buy products from Suppliers, like Alibaba, etc, you might generate a passive income. You can do a research on that topic. Options are unlimited you just have to find them. Travelling takes toll on one's body also it isn't as galmours or enjoyable as people make it seems. A man without a plan won't survive much would not recommend. I was in your place a few years ago. A little older, lesser LPA, more in bank. Headed north and stayed with a friend, planned to head further north to volunteer. Friend convinced me that was not what I wanted, plus had an epiphany over more rounds of beers than usual. Dropped the plan, got back in the grind, realized it is not time to give up just yet.

If the anecdote avove doesn't help, get and read the book Vagabonding by Rolf Potts. While I would've loved a life on the road, that life without purpose would have bored the fuck out of me in months, in not years. God, things would have been different, worlds apart even, but I'm happy and content now. To be frank, almost everyone hates their job and want to leave it and instead travel and enjoy their life, but only a few are able to do so due to various factors. 

I agree with the top comment. First take two weeks leave and then plan how you want to do it. 

For the money part, how much have you saved till now? Do you have any loans? Better invest your savings in 1)Gilt funds and 2) Overnight funds to get better returns than FD and Savings account respectively. As most people have suggested, take a shorter break and figure out what you’d like to do. Quitting before figuring out may backfire and you might end up in a worse place. 

What if you don’t like traveling after a few months? What if you don’t like psychology a few months after you start your education ? I’d suggest taking time off and volunteering/ shadowing or working part time in a field you like and testing the waters before making the leap. 

Also it might just be that you need to switch jobs in your industry and choose something more laid back, rather make a drastic change. Remember the grass always seems greener on the other side. Just take smaller steps to figure out things. Good luck. Tinnitus can make You feel like You have mental Health Problems.
But there's a cure for that.
When your tinnitus is gone, you will be thinking more clearly.
As you have already mentioned, your state is not the one to make a decision this big.
I would suggest you to just go on a medical leave for some time. Travel. Get best medical care for your tinnitus.
Once its cured and you have clarity, only then think about resigning. Do it. Leave the job. Listen to your heart. In my opinion, maybe you should take a break, like go hiking or enjoy a vacation and so on. Leave those works or making money stuff behind.",2019-07-14 20:21:29
Policy & Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,95,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,46,1562293745.0,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",MelodicBerries," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they’re busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it’s some weird waste of time in the “you aren’t even wrong” kind of bad.

I’m going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnamurthy_Subramanian#Career

>In articles published in The Times of India and Livemint titled, ""Will Black Be Back? Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India’s fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. 😂 Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

I've read the book called Nudge by Thaler. It could be a good thing if done right or it could be Orwellian if done wrong.",2019-07-05 07:59:05

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Satyamev Jayate.",toughbrain," 1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?
2. Don't you think Humanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea?
3. I see you have a highly ambitious vision (though vague here) is really appreciable. I will take a peek into it. Aaaah, the walls of text just got 10 feet higher. Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

>	Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  
I look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!

&#x200B;

My only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually. Indians: Neva! > But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. 



This statement is similar to that of Holocaust deniers. Caste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors, you can't say Muslim are responsible, or reservation cemented caste identities.


I would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947. I repeat, your statement is similar to telling Jewish people that Nazis were not responsible for Holocaust. You can't whitewash thousand year history.






> This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.


Mandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics. Dalits voted Lalu yadav because ranveer Sena did yadav/dalit massacres. Check the links between murli manohar Joshi and ranveer Sena.



Poverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991. Incidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started. Your claims that identity politics has hurt dalits won't be accepted by even forward castes.










> Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world.

250 million dalits are richer than ST and Muslims. Check facts.

> We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. 

Lol. I can't even. 

> When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. 


It's not about education, it's about ""equal opportunity"". You stop discrimination and it's enough for dalit progress.

> This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system.

How can you give justice to 70% SC,ST,OBC when there is zero judge in supreme Court from these castes? What about 90% supreme Court judges being brahmins?



> We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community 

Are you quoting Sumitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits?

> on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.


But there is persuasive evidence for that. 

> Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.







Your assumption that SC,ST wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd. You have freedom of expression which dalits respect. BJP is against reservation. In Bengal and Karnataka there are 24% dalits per state. Whole BJP victory in WB, Karnataka, Orissa was possible because of dalits. More dalits voted for NDA than UPA.



You should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this. It'd be really helpful if you added in links in your post. 

Also, kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change. Atleast, you haven't given up like me ✌️ How naive to assume that the social, economic, and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved. This is the problem of this sort of liberal, we all are equal, agenda, it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all. Whereas it overlook the fact that how Dalits and Adivasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility. props to people who read the entire thing👏

It would be nice to add a tl;dr in the end tho🤠 You will certainly have support from Enlightened youth who are of small proportion.But Its gonna take decades for good amount of common people to support and follow your party, Like you mentioned it's gonna take a long time. But I hope you progress swiftly. Humanist? Yeh kaun jaat hai? What is your take on illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Maybe a TL;DR at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about what's followed. What's your take on Christian missionaries and Islamic extremism? Our philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched - you lost me on that one. 

If the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years, why should it stay on?

Why should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward - Jats and Marathas? Not calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated, but trying to exclude ""secular"" doesnt make sense. Most of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for I can get behind, so I still want to see where this goes. Good luck. If you mean Hindutva as a religion, then definitely yes. But Hindutva as our culture/race can't be removed from us. Because that is what we are. Everyone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one, but the race is not a matter of choice. BJP is totally losing it by mixing Hindutva as a religion and Hindutva/Bharatiya as a race. If you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible. Shows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling. This is not going anywhere. Atrocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have? Won't lie, I am from right wing but I'll defect if you abolish reservation. You have my vote. Are you have an AMA . Fat Chance. You will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills - asking questions was never encouraged in India. Yawn ! 😪 I consider myself humanist. I see few fundamental issues which I figured through lot of introspection. These seem straightforward but no one follows these:

i) Do not give freedom of speech to a group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speech

ii) Do not give freedom of religion to group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religion

iii) Do not give property rights to group/person who campaigns to abolish property rights 

iv) Do not give human rights to persons who work against human rights.

and so on.

Criticism welcome. This naturally eliminates commies, jihadis, anti fos activists, criminals etc. and yet is 'humanist' in nature.

Logic is systems should have survival instincts else they die, however noble they may be. It this gonna be a face for new BJP .",2019-05-28 01:06:02

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this.",2019-07-05 22:51:58
Policy & Economy,"What do you think that a united India would have looked like in terms of development, the economy, foreign policy, et cetera?",12,cezrj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cezrj9/what_do_you_think_that_a_united_india_would_have/,6,1563520242.0,"What do you think that a united India would have looked like in terms of development, the economy, foreign policy, et cetera?

The compromises that the Congress and the Muslim league would have had to make to avoid partition would've led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces, this would've quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in India with the Muslim provinces of Kashmir, sind, eastern Bengal, Punjab (barely Muslim majority though),NWFP facing off against the Hindu provinces elsewhere.

There would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you can't even imagine. The Muslim league during British times often petitioned them to declare Sind and NWFP as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the Hindu dominated provinces of present day India like Bombay, Madras, UP etc. This was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a UP state passes a law banning say, cow slaughter then NWFP will pass a law banning public celebration of Diwali. This communalist tit for tat would've only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldn't have been confined to the border provinces of Punjab and Bengal but would've engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent. There would be riots in Sindh and in retaliation there would be riots in Kerala. 

In foreign policy terms India would have a restive Muslim population in Pakistan which would look for third party support from fellow Muslim nations of Iran and Afghanistan. This would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with Pashtuns in the case of Pakistan and Balochis in the case of Iran, crudely the Indus river actually is the real dividing line between Indian people and iranic people. The Indian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the Pakistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect. Pakistan has tried to pre empt Pashtun nationalism by raising up the Taliban to supplant it with Islamic radicalisation, an option not available to a Non Islamic Indian state. 

India would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in Central Asia and the middle East, both of the cold war (like Iran and Afghanistan) as well as the recent rise of Isis type Islamic extremism. This has nearly destroyed the Pakistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded India from the worst of it. The Punjabi Muslim (according to Ambedkar) was always the most susceptible to ideas of Muslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this (like with the Mujahideen). If these people were in the Indian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now, except now as citizens of India they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to Pakistan. 

In terms of economy, Ambedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day Pakistan were mostly a drag on the British exchequer while the Indian provinces were a tax surplus. This isn't necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between Hindu provinces and Muslim provinces then I struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great. Harmony is usually better for the economy than conflict.

The situation of minorities of all types would've been worse. Indian non muslims don't really care about the situation of their co religionists in Pakistan or Bangladesh. This is pretty much true for Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims as well with one huge exception being the Babri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in Bangladesh and Pakistan aimed at Hindus there, destroying temples and killing people etc. This wouldn't be the case in an undivided India, Hindu minorities in Muslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of Muslim minorities in Hindu provinces. This was an idea mooted solely by the Muslim league but I'm pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the Hindu communalists wouldn't be far behind in adopting this theory. Needless to say, not a good way to run a country.

People often say that India is secular only because it is 80% Hindu and I agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the Hindu faith, but because the question of religious hegemony in India is settled. The proportion of muslim in undivided India would've been large enough for the Hindus to start feeling threatened and for the Muslims to start demanding their pound of flesh (and maybe a bit more). The insecurity is highest at such a point where there's a chance of hegemonic change, it could've been a domestic variant of Thucydides Trap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country. Far better for one religious group to be in the outright, unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions.

Policy & Economy,Talk to you guys about my life in china,5,c629ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c629ts/talk_to_you_guys_about_my_life_in_china/,13,1561647389.0,"Five years ago, I was a Indian college student and I didn’t know anything about my own future.
 Just as I am about to graduate, I get an opportunity to study in China, and China’s policy for foreign students is tuition-free, and there are 20,000 scholarships each year.
 At this time, my brother told to me: ""China is also a developing country. The level of consumption is also very low. Our uncle is doing medical equipment business in Yiwu, China. You can also try it.""
 When I was confused, I followed my brother's advice and set off to study in China.

 Learning Chinese is not difficult at all, and oral Chinese is much easier. I was studying in Hangzhou, so I have visited around Zhejiang. 
 When I visited my uncle, I learned about the company him worked with, called Sunny world medical. I search it in google. I was very envious of my uncle, I wondered that I will become a millionaire just like my uncle after graduation. 
Now that India’s economy is improving day by day, people’s demand of medical care is even greater.
 So I took the opportunity to contact the medical device company named Sunny world medical in China.  I borrowed money from my uncle and contacted sunny world medical to place an order.
 This simple operation made me earn more than 20,000 CNY, nearly four times of the profit!

 At this time, I met a Vietnamese girl named ""Mary "". Her Chinese is better than me. I really like to study with her in the library.  Just then, a Pakistani man appeared.  After he came, Mary started  pay less attention to me day by day.
 I took this opportunity to express my confession, but she sent a text message saying that I am a loser, a social failure! This is really irritating!
 I am a South Indian, only 5 feet 5 inches tall. The Pakistani guy is 6 feet 4 feet tall.
 Mary must have dismissed my short. However, as a man, it is useless to be tall. What is important is how high his ambition is!
 So I worked hard and made another 60,000CNY in the previous method, and then I was only 22 years old!

 Thanks to the lack of the Indian market's large demand for the medical device industry, thanks to the sincerely Sunny world medical. Now, I am holding the tall Chinese girlfriend ,Sofia, I am no longer feel sorry about my own sense of failure. Because a man doesn’t depend on how tall he is, but how tall his wallet is.
 But sometimes ,especially at the midnight,i still miss Mary. What does she do? Does she happy? It not because how much i love her, but i love the most marvelous moment of myself.",healthcliffs-reddit," Saving this post locally just for the copypastas lmao XD Your English towards the end is atrocious, was it a consequence of learning Chinese ?

>Now, I am holding the tall Chinese girlfriend ,Sofia,....But sometimes ,especially at the midnight,i still miss Mary.

Why specifically midnight? Does Sophia turn into a vampire or something?

>Because a man doesn’t depend on how tall he is, but how tall his wallet is. 

Wallet hila ke so jaa Quora is that you? Mary had a little lamb How do I purchase 1,00,000 shares of Sunny world medical?! You lost me after, ""Learning Chinese is not difficult at all""...

Policy & Economy,Why didn't 'Nehruvian Socialism'/'Mixed economy' work?,12,c3cy06,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3cy06/why_didnt_nehruvian_socialismmixed_economy_work/,8,1561163959.0,"First of all I would like to say, I have never studied economics and don't understand it very much either. So, if possible ELI5.

All I have seen since I became politically aware a few years ago, is that there are people in America and India fighting about whether Socialism is good or Capitalism is good. Here is what I have gathered so far:

Nehru was influenced by Europe. So, he chose the European model (which is socialism, as I have read) to implement in new India (after independence) in contrast to American model which was capitalistic. It helped start India but India lagged behind other developing nations, progress was 'slow'. Then, in 1990, 'economic liberalization' happened and we became capitalistic. Our economy got a boost. So, as people claim, Nehru's socialism didn't work.

However, European countries are rich and successful nations (that's what I have heard) even though are are 'kinda' socialistic, i.e., a 'Mixed Economy' which combines socialism and capitalism. I have heard from other sources that Nehruvian socialism was actually mixed economy and not hardcore socialism like, say, Soviet Union. I have also heard that under Barack Obama, USA was a mixed economy too. If that's the case, why didn't mixed economy work here? What was the problem?

USA voted for Trump because of capitalistic economic policies. So, I conclude that people of USA were fed up of mixed economic policies. So, did mixed economy fail to work in USA?

Also, a side question: Mixed economy didn't work in early India. Does that mean it still won't work, or ever work in the future?",Suradoe," At the time of Independence we lacked capacity to manufacture capital goods. So there was a consensus at that time that Public Sector will lead the way in producing capital goods. Import substitution was considered as the way forward. 

In 1956 Avadi session of Congress it was decided that we'd adopt socialist model for our economy with private sector competing with public sector. The causes of failure were many:

1) Labor laws were too stringent that it became hard to fire someone even if they were underperforming. That problem still persists

2) Monopolies Restrictive Act (or something like that) kinda prevented firms from growing big

3) Small scale industries couldn't expand either as that would take them out of businesses which were reserved only for small scale industries

4) Public Sector enterprises weren't really efficient because of absence of competition. There was no clarity on what their objective was (whether it's making profits or public service). For example some people used to say how it took them months to get telephone connection those days. 

5) Government was taking over 'sick' companies like Mills which it shouldn't have done in the first place

6) The income tax was prohibitively high on individuals (97 per cent at one point). How can one make money with such rates? That was acting as disincentive. There are several misconceptions in the OP that I shall try to clear before I answer the crux of the question, that is,  why didn't Nehruvian Socialism work. 

Firstly, let's ask ourselves what is socialism. According to Karl Marx, all production takes place due to the combination of labour and capital. This is a relatively standard economic assumption that dates back to Adam Smith and is still used in traditional Economics to this day. Marx's theory postulates that labour is the true source of all production because capital is just dead or crystallised labour. Suppose to produce a chair I need someone to feed wood into a machine. The people we need is labour and the machine that produces the chair is capital. However, this capital was produced by someone else. Some labour was applied to a raw or intermediary good to make it into a machine. If we take this all the way backwards to the first step,  it's clear to see that capital is just labour that has taken place in the past. According to Marx society organises itself around the relations of production, that is society organises itself based on how labour is controlled in societies. All societies pass through stages: a slave state where labour is held within people but people could be owned. Thus he who held slaves commanded labour power and thus controlled society. Eventually slavery would be supplanted by feudalism where labour power was attached to land and he who held land controlled society. Feudalism would eventually be supplanted by capitalism where he who holds capital, also known as private property,  has command of labour and thus controls society. According to Marx, eventually the workers would realise that they were the source of productive power and would engage in a revolution to control society themselves. Socialism is therefore any political ideology that seeks to reduce the power of capital in society,  that is,  to alter the capital labour relationship. If your ideology tries to reduce the power of capital in favour of the power of labour, you are a socialist. 

During his time in England, Nehru was inspired by the Fabian Society which founded the London School of Economics and Political Science. The Fabian society believed that it was possible for Socialism to be achieved democratically, by nationalising the ""commanding heights"" or most important sectors of the economy while still allowing the market or capitalism to provide for commercial goods. Thus the Fabian socialists which influenced Clement Attlee's 1945-51 Labour Party rule in the UK and the Congress Party for the entirty of its rule, (indeed to this day), argued that the most important sectors like steel and iron, infrastructure, and power generation should be run by the government while the private sector can compete and provide for things like chairs and tables and jewellery and watches. 

This model also called as Social Democracy is the primary model in Europe. Nehru tried to adapt the model to India. The problem with this model, is that even from a Marxist perspective it runs contrary to how Socialism ought to function. Marx was not against capitalism blindly. In fact, much of Capital praises capitalism for its revolutionary character. It increased the productive capacity ten thousand fold whereas both slave states and Feudalism were slow and static. According to Marx you need capitalism to flourish to increase the productive capacity of society, such that eventually labourers can use the productive capacity to benefit all of society instead of just the holders of capital. Nehru's model placed so many restrictions on businesses and the INC nationalised them suddenly on the fly such that there was no means by which the productive capacity could grow as the private sector saw no point in investing to generate productive capacity. 

This ties into the problems the Soviets faced too from the Brezhnev era onwards. Once the Stalinist police state was abolished there were no incentives for state firms to actually do well and outperform the government set quotas. For much of the 1970s and 80s firms actually worked under capacity because if they outperformed their quota by a significant amount it would lead to an increase in the quota expected with no remunerations or benefits to the manager or worker for doing better than expected. 

Social Democracy is primarily a European phenomenon. The USA does have a mixed economy but from significantly different roots. The American Liberalism movement owes its ideological basis to the British liberal party who were and (even now are) actually bitter rivals of the socialists. It arose from UK PM David Lloyd George's People's Budget, the Beveridge Report and Keynes. This philosophy known as Social Liberalism argues that capitalism is actually great, but private property unregulated doesn't lead to the best possible outcomes, or as US Mass Senator Elizabeth Warren pithily put it, ""markets without rules are little more than theft"". The American and British social liberals argue that capitalism is great, but we need systematic checks on the market, coming from the government to make sure that capitalism works. So while Obama also supports a mixed economy, it's not because like the Labour Party or Nehru they're trying to alter the distribution of the means of production but because they realise that capitalism without a government presiding over it doesn't work. 

Free marketeers argue in favour of a market uninhibited by a massive government. According to them government regulations distort the market and cause capital to be allocated elsewhere than where it is most productive this affects society by reducing the returns from capital and making society grow slower than it ought to.

The problem with this is that it ignores what social Liberalism found out: that you need a government sector to make capitalism work. One of the best examples of this is Lula da Silva's government in Brazil. Lula da Silva led the Brazilian Worker's Party to victory twice during which he adopted social liberal policies. He did not attempt to alter the capital labour distribution in a developing society. Instead, he facilitated business as much as possible while trying to redistribute the returns to the poorest sections of society to make everyone better off. During Lula' s administration, he pulled millions out of poverty while enabling Brazil to grow at the highest rate of sustained economic growth in its entire history. 

This is not to suggest that social liberalism is always better than social democracy. While social liberalism helps business and thus the economy grow rapidly while bringing people out of poverty, it also increases income and wealth inequality. Eventually once society develops its productive capacity sufficiently (like Europe) it ought to embrace social democracy,  which is what Bernie Sanders is trying to do in the United States. 

I realise this is really long winded but hoped it answered your question! As for your side question no economy is purely capitalistic or purely socialistic. What can make mixed economy tick is where public sector spends the money. When you have government pouring money in a sector where private players are dominant (like in Telecom sector) it is bound to fail because private players are nimble and adapt to changes faster. 

On the other hand social sectors like Education, Hospitals, drinking water supply are the responsibility of the government. Where it fails it would allow private players to exploit the people especially the most vulnerable. Government has competing needs to meet for which it has limited sum to spend. Where it decides to spend decides the fate of the nation. I think you are confused with Mixed economy and social economy.

India is a mixed economy, not a social economy, it simply means that there are certain sectors where both private players and government can participate. Whereas under social economies government either directly or directly control most of the sectors.

To be honest, no system is perfect, socialism has failed in the majority of the countries like Cuba it does not encourage individuals to work hard and take risks. Whereas capitalism if done with honesty can lead to development usually it creates greed for more wealth which leads to poverty, corruption, income inequality.

&#x200B;

The post-independence Indian economy was a mixed economy, it had the potential to take the positives from both social and capitalistic economies, but we took the negatives from both.

Most of the state-owned corporations were managed by politically influenced persons who may have lacked the skills/motivation to successfully run Government corporations.

For private players the situation was no better, there were numerous rules and regulations which needed to be followed, License Raj was demotivating the private players, the banking sector which is the backbone of any economy was underdeveloped. It was very tough to start let alone run new businesses.

India's growth prior to 1990's was slower but we need to understand that we were a new nation and perhaps even the opposition were not strong enough to motivate the ruling government to bring in and execute new reforms. Nehru and people from 1930s are product of socialism. Hence everyone favoured so. Obviously evil of capitalism was well known. All the policies decided based on this framework. But during globalization flood gates opened and everyone got taste of profit and exponential growth and suddenly love of other extreme things. UK, US are product of capitalism from 19th century. Those days liberals are pro capitalism. Come to 1950, liberals love socialism. And cycle keeps repeating Whole system of fractured corrupt broken democracy doesn’t work in India . Meritocracy along likes of East Asian nations is the way to go .  Due to Idiot Indian leaders we missed manufacturing bus .",2019-06-22 06:09:19

I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

So I'm 22. Just out of college having studied finance and business, I feel I am ready to start with a small amount, I have a little over a Lakh saved for stocks. My questions are, what is the best method to invest in them personally? ie I want to manage it myself, not a broker or anything. Secondly, I am aware of the Valuation methods such as DDM and Cash FLow Valuation. I can even do a thorough financial Analysis of the company's accounts having a finance background.

Guys that have been doing it for a while, it would be great if you could share your stories and help a young guy out.",BatsmenTerminator," Hey dude, I started investing in Jan. I am sharing what I learned in the last few months.

* Read ""One Up on Wall Street"" by Peter Lynch. It will give you a new perspective to look at companies.
* You should start with Nifty 50 companies. Those companies will not die and will force you into a habit to checking financial news and the stocks prices in general.
* Create a portfolio on google finance or moneycontrol of companies you think you will be interested in.
* Read news related to your portfolio companies.
* Use screener.in for stock screening.
* Its better to buy when the stock market is down. Jan-Feb was the perfect time to join for me since every stock was down. So I invested in some blue chip companies all of which are giving me > 10% return. 
* Since the market is still fluctuating look for days when it has gone down to pick up stocks.
* Start slow with 15-20k and look at how things work out.
* Don't pick expensive shares which cost more than 1000 or ones with PE ratio more then 20. Since if you will be able to buy on 10-15 shares so even if the prices go up by 100 the net income will be only 1000 (you will pay brokerage also on this).  Also price change of 100 does not happen so quickly.

The best way to learn is to start investing. Do not be afraid of failures. Take calculated risks on how much you can afford to lose.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT invest in individual stocks after analyzing their cash flow you read through their annual reports. 

1- That information is already priced-in. People have priced the stock based on that information. 

2- There are people with better information then you, those who know CFO ( insider trades) , have been given a tour of the factory( analysts) or understand the sector far better than you. Also there are billion dollar companies who have far more advanced models than what your quad core laptop can possibly run. 

In short, you will not be a player with any advantage by analyzing cash flows. 

3- If you want to invest to make money, invest in mutual funds because frankly they exploit insider information to identify better stocks than you will. They know the govt. policy before it is made public. etc. etc. 

If you want to invest to learn, try building a portfolio on one of those finance sites like Yahoo finance etc. etc. In fact it may be better to pick up a mature market like US for that since there will be lot more data available for you to analyze. You don't need real cash for that ! 

My credentials are that I was in investment management business for 1 year. I have sold hedge funds and REIT's. Trust me, trading directly in stocks is dangerous, although in my stupid bravado, I still sometimes do it :( 

 Log on to www.zerodha.com and create an account. They'll ask you for some ID proof etc. and then set you up with a Demat and Trading account. You can then buy Shares, Mutual Funds, Commodities, Futures and Options, and even Currency Futures. They're one of the cheapest brokerages in India. 

I currently trade with them and so far haven't had any complaints.  Is it worth the time it requires keeping tabs on companies and all? Few basics to covers

Decide what you want to become, a broker i.e one who looks at stock prices every single day and worries about the market fluctuation or an investor who wants to own part of a business because of a hope that you may make some money in future and you believe that company would be able to better use your money for the time you have invested in it than you would. 


If you are looking to become a stock broker than i don't have any advice for you  and you can stop reading here i am sure someone else would be better to help but if you want to become an investor then i have somethings that might be of interest.

Never try to time the market. You need a special kind of luck and very very special talent to do that.  From where you sit, I would recommend you investing your time in building up your career.

Your Dad is partly right, lot of smaller companies do play dirty but if you stick to large and mid cap companies and looking at their 10 year financials helps you figure out which is good and which is bad company to invest.

Most people should stick to mutual funds but if you really want to get our hands wet then get a brokerage account from Zerodha or Indiabulls and start learning fundamental analysis.

This was a long time coming. Finally declared officially. ""Speaker Sir!!! Now, I want you to tell me what you understood from everything I said!""

Speaker's smile will go away. There's now a 5% custom duty on printed books!! There's also a 15% Custom duty on chargers for CCTV/DVR etc., which was nil earlier. Startups not reqd to justify FMV. A good move. But startups should maintain ethics and not start abusing thus independence. Another underwhelming budget. Modi is no reformer just a frightened chicken who pretends to be strong. All labour laws will be bundled into 4 codes.

Good first step towards streamlining the mess.

Just to give an idea , there are 1000+ minimum wage for various different posts. There needs to be consolidation in all such laws to ensure more simplicity for compliance Sampada yojana, okay, this one should have been stressed and has been rightfully stressed. Thanks for this Is it true that only 3% people pay tax in our country? Government needs to simplify the GST regime enough that any 10th pass can fill his monthly returns without having to be at the mercy of a CA

Automated processing and refund is a step in the right direction on taxmen side. Now make it easier for customer to fill it too *Additional deduction of ₹1.5 lakh on loans up to March 31 2020 for buying affordable houses, giving ₹ 7 lakh benefit to home buyers*

What does this mean? How does it effect existing folks who have a housing loan? >The mission to make water accessible to the poor appears to be only  driven by the intent of creating good optics, rather than any true  commitment.

[This article by The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/budget-2019-drinking-water-jal-shakti-ministry) reports that the funding to the Jal Jeevan Mission has been reduced since 2017-18 in a time when the most focus is required on solving the looming water crisis. Speaker is sleeping with his smile on. What's the point of introducing ₹20 coin? HNIs are fucked. They will fly en masse. This faceless interaction for assessment sounds huge. Like how will this work? Can someone summarize highlights in a single post? How many people of a given Indian metro city file tax returns of 20-30% vs how many white board cars are there in a city?

  
Government is thanking tax payers. That's not enough, they have to return by pushing for more tax enforcement for tax evaders which will reduce the burden overall bringing down the tax rates. In other news, government recently proposed a bailout of 100,000 crores for bsnl / mtnl.

Hopefully, this time BSNL is allowed to bid in 5g auction unlike the last time when the imbecile NDA didn't allow them to bid for 4g and imbecile upa not allowing them to bid on 3g Corporate tax ki googly mari Have a noob question - let's say if I earn 6 lac pa will I have to pay tax on 1 lac(since no tax until 5 lac) or on 6 lac or something else? [deleted] Just started watching, The heck? Why is this so detail light? Is everything being pushed to a committee or a new plan? We will make a committee to manage the committees which will solve our problems?

Was there a section with more detail that I missed? Air india ko nahi bechenge par working psus like ongc la strategic disinvestment zaroor karenge. Kya hi chudaap hain IFSC wala incentive badhiya hain A private company employee slogs for 8-10 hours, struggles in metros, buses, autos and trains to reach office, misses lunches and breakfasts to pay taxes for overpaid and highly inefficient and careless officers and workers of PSU who drag the PSUs into bailout conditions. The fact that the finance minister mentioned everything that has happened in the country in past 5 years except demonetization is the true judgement of the government on its results! The biggest disappointment in this budget was that there is nothing in it for growth of jobs. FFS without jobs, your ""proposals"" of EVs, taxes, housing for all, etc. are of no use. Keep refiling the banks, that'll make a $5 trillion economy. My father says ""Indian Economics is beyond your understanding"".

*Sighs* [deleted] For all the right wing ideology, this budget is pretty socialist, I feel. Aur 15 20 min kheech lijiye saheba, you will have the record of longest budget speech to your name Govt. revenues grow at double digits and still not enough.

Private companies barely crossing 5% growth.

We really are stupid sheep. RIP Pan card They are trying to impose aadhar forcefully. Which again buttressed my fears on how they are trying to create a data monopoly and a surveillance state >'""NPS trust to be separated from PFRDA   

what !  

>NBFCs - that are fundamentally sound, will get fundings from govt to a total of 1lakh crore during the current financial year: FM  


In plainspeak : bailouts for NBFCs   

>Government to offer ETF in line of ELSS   

that CPSE ETF to get 3-yr lock-in & eligible for ELSS ?   

>No disinvestment in Air India    


yeah. it is not like there's a queue of buyers for that taxmoney blackhole . Nothing on jobs,nothing related to agriculture.foolish budget Nirmala ditched the briefcase in favor of a bahi khata. The new CEA described it as ""[symbolising our departure from the slavery of Western thought](https://i.imgur.com/lUz4FHd.png
)"". 

I had earlier speculated over the radical language in the economic survey implying a clear break from the past and this symbolism increases that. Let's see if the budget follows through on all this language. That speaker's smile is creepy! The budget's fiscal deficit calculation of 3.3% for 2019-2020 (Estimated) is based on the indian economy growing by 12 % over this year ! 

&#x200B;

""GDP for BE 2019-2020 has been projected at 21100607 crore assuming 12.0 % growth over the estimated GDP of \`18840731 crore for 2018-2019 (RE)"" 

\-Footnote page 3 of [Budget at a glance](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_at_Glance/bag1.pdf)

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

This is another great podcast by Kalki Can you also add where these podcasts are available? The Inside Line. A F1 podcast, is one the best F1 podcast. Coming out of a not F1 loving country, its surprisingly Good. Kaanmasti on YouTube has Jose and Suresh menon. Its fun and the conversations are love. This is really helpful..Thanks ! NL Hafta is subscription based. You can access new episodes via their website but on the app they come late since they can't authenticate users. NL Hafta is behind a paywall but another top top quality podcast by Newslaundry is Reporters without Orders. They talk about the news that was under-reported, over-reported etc.

Here's a link to their podcast - 
https://soundcloud.com/user-711229729 http://www.thelewdcabal.com/ For indie pop you can check out DiscoverDesi Thanks man  
Helpful post The history of india podcast is one of my favorites   [https://historyofindiapodcast.libsyn.com/](https://historyofindiapodcast.libsyn.com/) Great post. I think you should make it a regular feature and rather than posting all your suggestions in one big post, make it a monthly or weekly post where you focus on 2-3 good podcasts.

I find a lot of my podcasts from your first category, and my app is filled with so many podcasts that sometimes I get stressed out that i'm not able to listen to them. Also I'm not able to do multiple stuff when listening to a podcast, any suggestions on that front? SynTalk is great too.

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this.",2019-07-05 22:51:58

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Summary:  Low impact on personal finance as such.  There are some good noises on NBFC, startup, etc.  More help given to small businesses in GST.  Gold duty hiked to 12.5%.

Edit: Custom duty hike in many electronic items. This can affect your purchase decisions.  Mi phones may become cheaper than OnePlus :-)

i see news that DHFL isn't repaying depositors.

further, there's some look out notice issued against DHFL promoters.

also, DHFL's stock price has been going down steep the past year.   

&nbsp;  

1. what exactly is the problem at DHFL?  
1. are they seeing poor loan repayments by home loan borrowers?  
1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?",donoteatthatfrog," There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

This is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL.",2019-05-29 18:28:13

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",baawri_kathputli," Bought air sahara despite warning from experts, had to write off, resulting cash shortage. Also stress sector and unstable government policies. [deleted] Read this article

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India’s much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I’m glad they’re out of business. I’ve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :(",2019-04-18 07:09:57

■ **Ornit Shahni, [How India Became Democratic](https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/how-india-became-democratic/) (Penguin, 2018)**

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/the-verdict/ Thank you for making the list, OP.  A forthcoming book that looks interesting as well is Ruchir Sharma's Democracy on the Road (Penguin) but I haven't read that as yet.  Thanks for the list OP. There's also a new podcast by Milan Vaishnav called [Grand Tamasha](https://carnegieendowment.org/grandtamasha/) . It is a co-prod with HT and Darnegie Endowment for Peace. I recommend The Verdict. Also off topic, but can someone recommend a book that summarises the Constituent Assembly Debates about what went into making the constitution? mandatory mention of India After Gandhi, which covers the first election (and some important subsequent elections) I'd add Ruchir Sharma's **Democracy on the Road: A 25 Year Journey through India** to this list. 

From the 1990s to December 2018, he and journalist/analyst friends of his basically take road trips to most Indian states to see state and general election campaigns. It cites many of the academics listed in this thread, but it's a book for everyone and each chapter covers a different election.

Finance & Business,I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,347,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,116,1544618818.0,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",badger991," It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there’ll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   Why do you think Dr. Kurian didn't think highly of IAS folks, they are generalists not specialists. Das will help with the looting, this is their second attempt at demo to financially hamstring the opposition and slurp the RBI reserve. Our stewards have turned weak and spineless like Theoden. A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped 😑 He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone 😂 Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI.

The production quality of this show is just amazing. I don't know where I have been but all I wanted was to fuck ass! :)

This will be a meme for sure. So all 15 th August plan cancelled !!! Post the K-wave, West had its golden era of TV which is still on-going.  
India sort of went in an interesting way post 80s. TV wasn't dominant but it wasn't small either. And then it become irrelevant and Bollywood just became too big.  

India has enough of a market to sustain TV market. It just needs a certain quality and that requires some examples which work and SG did that because it has roped in major stars.  
If other stars start doing it it will open up the sector. 

That is if everything does well. 
Movies are not improving, maybe TV shows is where quality might appear because of the platform dynamic, bad quality products rarely survive while due to the nature of Theater/Screen growth in India it means Movie Producers don't have to care about quality that much, they can just ride the underlying growth wave and with massive marketing make up enough money in 3 weeks and be gone.  

In TV shows, 2nd season or so doesn't happen if something is a dud. More competition fuels more quality, in principle. ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪ Vibhin vibhin shauk hain logo ko, kisi ko marni hai and kisi ko....

But make no mistake. They are not. Stardom has gone to most of their heads and they are not to be blamed. We are. 

They are just actors. They are not scientists or innovators that are doing something for the benefit of society. Lets give our scientists and geniuses that stardom instead of these actors.",yourBaap," What you said is definitely true it's not limited to movie stars it's true for every other celebrities like athletes, singers etc. I don't think  worshipping will stop, but I think it's their attitude that will take them down.  [deleted] As a PhD student who really really loves doing science, I think it’s okay for entertainers to be more popular than scientists, engineers and doctors. It is dangerous for science to try to become too popular because most people do not read the fine lines and are mostly happy with half baked knowledge. Half baked scientific knowledge started the movements for anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and climate change deniers...
People are not okay with the amount of self doubt and negative results scientists deal with in their experiments.
Also I can see the effect, popularity has on science. Everyone wants a publication in Nature and Science, making every group move towards novelty sacrificing reproducibility. You should lookup how many papers had to be retracted from such high impact journals because data was produced fraudulently (and how many more are still out there with questionable data).

Here’s my take on this. Pay as much attention as you want to movie stars, but always highlight that they are humans, and their persona is created by a team of specialists who are paid a lot of money. A good way to do that, I have found, is reminding people that they too take a dump in the morning and suffer from neck pain in the evening.
Also pay some attention to scientists when they appear on page 8 of the newspaper. Some of them are doing really interesting work. People question why there is no Nobel from xxx institutes. My counter is how many people do you know who won the Infosys award or Shanti Swarup award? Nobel prize is a different ball game that involves not just the scientists but also the projected might of a country. Ye bik gaya hai Bollywood. Sab milke hamko pagal bana rahe hai ...

Only Vidya Balan, Arshad Warsi, Raza Murad and Saumya Tandon refused to take money for political posts. Can someone explain to me why  Sanjay Dutt goes to jail for owning guns while Salman Khan is chilling despite killing a human being. It's a remnant of the post Independence era. Back in those days, movies were the only affordable source of entertainment and some movie makers felt the need to spread a social message through the movies since it had such a far reach. I think this is particularly true in South India where some actors were literally prayed as the gods they played on screen (NTR, MGR, Rajkumar etc). Some of those actors took up the social responsibility and wouldn't play certain roles in the fear that fans might emulate it and cause harm. 

That attitude has continued to this day, where some people identify the actors based on the characters they have played, leading to this weird glorification. Terrible human beings? Eh. Debatable. 

But this stardom culture is indeed absolute cancer. People care more about the guy acting than the movie itself!  I don’t get it either. 

I can wrap my mind around singer-songwriters achieving that level of adulation because the process of writing and performing music is deeply personal and you’re gaining an insight into an artist’s psyche, drawing parallels and deriving some kind of meaning out of it. Being inspired to write poetry, or pick up an instrument and evoke emotion out of it is a worthy skill and outlet.

I also get fandom around athletes - it essentially drills down to themes of discipline, endurance, skill, fitness, all things regular everyday people can aspire to emulate.

I totally get it if someone wants to emulate Tendulkar or Messi, Gulzar or Rahman, but modeling your own personality and mannerisms after Salman or Mahesh Babu I don’t understand.

This also ties into why desi musical.ly/TikTok is cancer. Also don't forget that while most of these fuckers pretend to be liberals and progressive in real life, the choice of movies they make and bear no sense of responsibility for it tells otherwise. For example, Ranveer Singh's movie Simba was a shit show of toxic masculinity and he's not even in a position that he has to do these kind of movies to make ends meet. Indian public considers the actor's personality to be the persobality of the character they play. The reason behind Amitabh bacchan's God status is the same as well. Start calling them Actors. They are not ""stars"" ffs.  I agree. You have no idea how people in Tamil Nadu here are obsessed with Vijay/Ajith, Rajini/Kamal, etc., it's just insane.  This applies to Hollywood stars too. Except, they have excellent PR and support structures like talk shows to build the artificial personality. These actors are just exaggerated image of ourselves. > A few friends of mine are in the movie industry and from them I have heard terrible things about these movie stars. 

You need to elaborate. Give us examples. Only read the title & I can't agree more on it. I believe empathy can allow for vicarious joy, and people who often don't have joy in their lives get it from fantasy. Bollywood provides that fantasy and people can find also some meaning in it. After all India is the land of idol-worship, and has been for thousands of years. Bollywood is simply the latest god creating engine. its universal, not an Indian specific phenomenon. Another reason why people like Kashyap etc will never get the praise they deserve.. nor will people like Raj kumar Rao and Irrfan Khan or Pankaj Trivedi .. so many names.

&#x200B;

Indian Bollywood demography is made of 98% people who like to escape the reality of life and forget the problems they see. Instead movies by these stars(Salman etc..) give them a way to escape. Its everything that a normal Indian man can dream of because lets be honest, the people who are living that dream are busy building it rather than being social media warriors or running a twitter fan account. The 2% who don't care, really dont care. They prefer art than fame. I agree with you point in general but.....

`Most, I repeat, most of them are pathetic, egoistic and are terrible human beings.` 

...don't you think this is too strong a opinion.....unless of course you were personally treated badly by most of them. I think you should talk about the terrible things your friends told you about. We probably respect them because we know those guys are filthly rich.

We respect rich people. It's something that's universal, and I don't know how the perception of people is gonna change. Everyone wants to be famous, and in process of getting famous, end up doing the same thing they criticized at one point of time. I mean, you like their movies , fine, don't fucking go all crazy about them. Set some goals in your life and by God, achieve them or die trying.

Peace out. I think media has a big role in this widespread popularity of these celebs. They chase them everywhere from gym to temple, write stories and gossips about em.  You can tell a lot about a person depending upon which actor he likes to watch on screen. It was different in the 1990s. 
Now a days, it's all about celebrity kids and launching them and KwK. Glamour has taken over and bulldozed movie making, story telling or even captivating the audience.
Lastly, Bollywood has run out of original ideas and music. 
I guess of all of the industries, the Bollywood is the least talented.  The movies get attention because people dont have have any hobbies except watching movies and listening music. Literally 80 percent of the city crowd spends their weekend watching some stupid movie. I'm interested to hear some incidents from you OP.
 Many of them are war mongers. I guess it helps sell their movies.  So being a scientist is somehow better than being an actor? That is just flawed logic. I am not saying that we should worship film stars but what they do is as important as a scientist because they provide much needed entertainment. It'll be harder to live without either of them. Also, this supports the idea that no job is unimportant. Thanks for ranting this out, while many of us believe the same way as you do but we don't let this out because we still think it's not going to change what's on the minds of those who rate these celebrities/athletes/politicians/news reporters into super great human beings. Who to  blame for? The  reason behind everything is ultimately us - People of our country only. We spend our time and money to get entertained be it movies sports media, and we see it - we pay for it, they get rich they show you more, we see it more and we pay for it more - they get richer and richer. 

If a rich guy wears and lives a simpler life he will be considered simplistic and respected more. The same rich guy wears and lives lavish life he will obviously be seen as someone who is some God like figure who cannot be reached but only admired!  I only watch their movies for entertainment nothing more. Then they get into politics and continue being themselves, especially down south  If it isnt too much to ask, could you please share what your friends in the movie industry told you, I dont care if its verified or not but want to know more about these claims Holds true for film stars, politicians..and cricketers. And it's not a comment on whether any one batch is more deserving of such adulation or not.
Indians like to take the same emotionally charged route ..to fandom as well.

A politician surrounded by security, inaccessible is deemed respectable, strong; but when another chooses to be without security.. like an aam aadmi, gets slapped by an random idiot in public, ensuring status quo of the bloated egos.

Cricketers, or film stars idolized here can't enjoy a normal night out ever. So England with its subtle appreciation provides a semblance of normalcy. It's. a refreshing change of pace to watch test cricket in England, you get to experience the endangered expression that is clapping in a sporting arena. You can spot the odd Savile row clad gentleman taking a nap, which is such a contrast from anything one sees in an Indian arena. Again not a rating or statement of preference, just of difference. Virgin sounds like, hahahahaha. It seem he get so many breakups, because his girls realize that he wants to remain virgin. I don't see anything wrong with being a super fan of someone or a bunch of people, as along as it's not to ridiculous levels as some Indians tend to do. 

Like the Salman Khan thing, he ran over and killed someone but it's okay because he gives a lot to charity.. at least that's what I kept hearing whenever the topic came up. I agree with your thought that we should give that much respect to scientists,astrologer and many more genieus which help us to enhance toward more development and empowerment. ""They are just actors. They are not scientists or innovators that are doing something for the benefit of society. Lets give our scientists and geniuses that stardom instead of these actors.""

&#x200B;

Scientists and innovators can be assholes too. Bad people are there in every field. You are just recommending us to blindly glorify one group instead of another. 

Also, actors can contribute to society through art. I'm not saying all do, but many do.

&#x200B;

I think the bottom line is, stop with the generalizations ! Agree with you OP, except this malaise is not limited to stars - its the same across Sports, and ahem - politics. The myth of an all conquering superhero is one that provides us relief from the humdrum that is everyday life. Especially because the 'system' is always weighted against the common man. Its not possible for someone to have planned, determined success and be celebrated. It has to be superstardom. They only runs behind money. Movie stars, cricketers, politicians, rowdies/dons/.. all 4 get this GODly treatment. Bollywood is proof that an Indian invented 0! They should be fucked The malaise is not limited to India. Look at the Twitter following of Hollywood celebrities and socialites. Maybe it is a human psyche to treat this people like G*d One thing i know for sure is salman is not like bajrangi bhaijaan he is like Micheal De Santa They are upscale prostitutes.....the very definition of acting is pretending to be someone/something you are not. Why Salman Khan is so popular among fans. He is women silent killer, he is murderer and bad human being.  There are just way too many low iq people in india. Simply a matter of population size.  if you would have worked as hard as shahrukh did you would not be ranting here  It's adopted more in the south i think..  I'm just curious why you wrote GODs. Is G-O-D an acronym for something?",2019-03-05 08:24:27
Entertainment,"Joe Russo (Director of Avengers Endgame) and AR Rahman at Taj lands end, Mumbai yesterday for the first ever Fan Event in India",155,b8ed2z,https://i.redd.it/m3ps4zrg2sp21.jpg,38,1554207801.0,,hatefulpoop," I seem to be the only one not into super hero movies :-( Finally India gets some cool shit. I remember before Infinity war's release we in Melbourne got Avengers Academy where you could become a SHIELD agent and see all the cool props but nothing was planned for India. 

But Infinity war ended up making up the same amout of money in Australia and India which annoyed me as to why the market was not being recognized as a potential growth area. Disney even got one of the stadiums in Melbourne to be renamed as Marvel stadium ffs. How is this event not more popular?  That is awesome. But do they have permission from Jio to host the event? If not, Avengers will be banned in India and theaters will have to use a VPN. Isn't that like an (Infinity) Stone's throw away from SRK's house? is it on tv or youtube? I really wish I could have attended it but only found out about it after they announced the winners. Still, I guess the audience must have received some really cool stuff, unseen footage.

Entertainment,"Why does it feel that dancing, singing, acting/comedy are the only talents in this country?",68,b1urxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b1urxj/why_does_it_feel_that_dancing_singing/,16,1552785387.0,"Every other Hindi and local language channel is either broadcasting some singing & dancing competition or there are men dressed up as women doing slapstick comedy/acting. And these channels mint a lot of money with these broadcasts. Sports media has at least evolved to bring badminton, *kabaddi*, etc. into mainstream where earlier only cricket ruled. I personally don't have anything against these forms of entertainment, however, it kind of feels like these are the only few talents left in a country of over a billion people. 

By identifying only a few selected fields as ""profitable"", are we failing to provide people with other talents the platform and support they require? For e.g. we all know where India stands at the Olympics medals tally. Had cricket not been so widely assumed the only ""profitable"" sport to invest in, don't you think India would have a larger Olympic medals count today?

Growing up we had programmes like quiz competitions, science exhibitions, educational debates, classical arts, etc. Now everything is either a singing or a dancing competition. Comedy too is just so loud with all the unnecessary canned laughter tracks. I am probably exaggerating this but is this just what we've become? Or are these programmes the result of what we've always been? A bunch of loud people consuming more and more noise everyday. 
",askquestionsdude," We love glamor and celebrity which is found in plenty on these shows so the popularity is obvious. I don't understand how people manage to sit through sheer vulgarity in comedy shows with their entite family watching.  I think it's similar in sports 

Cricket gets so much exposure from media and majority of kids are interested in becoming a cricketer.  You act like someone who does not interact with our countrymen :)

The audience is not refined/smart enough for anything else.

At best, we can have a contest where people show how much they hate other countries :) I've often asked myself the same question and haven't been able to find a convincing answer. Nothing against the dancing/singing shows per se but it sure would be nice if there were other talent searches on our tv channels. :)  
I remember forcing my son to watch Bournvita Quiz Contest every Sunday in 1996 on ZeeTV when we got the chance. It is a shame that the host, Derek, joined politics. It was a waste of talent.

It is good to see someone share the same opinion here...as Vishal Sikka said, we give too much importance to ""Nach Baliye"" than STEM fields.  


One of the reasons is that earlier, there used to be a collective national conscience to do something for the country. It was reflected in the national campaigns that Doordarshan ran courtesy of Piyush Pandey : Mile Sur Mera Tumhara was a perfect example which conveyed national integration based music. ""School chale hum"" was yet another example on radio when my kids were growing up at least passing on the message of development for all.  


I think over time, this collective conscience is somehow lost in the ether. Also, we stopped giving importance to people who had integrity and character and had a vision for the nation. APJ Abdul Kalam, Bhagat Singh, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, PV Narasimha Rao, Vajpayee....all their legacies are being forgotten by the people simply because they do not get the time for it : there is PUBG to be played nowadays.  


Instead of ranting, I would request all Redditors to provide a decent education for their children and to themselves so that they take steps towards nation building.  All over the world, the most common reality shows involve comedy, dancing, and singing. There really plenty of quiz shows that happen. They just moved them to news channels. Check out Tata crucible. talent is  something you earn money in india This is not an Indian phenomenon though, it's worldwide. And it's not really a question of intellect to be honest.

The thing is, with the advent of social media, it has becomee easier to aspire to become a celebrity-something that has acquired a lot of economic and cultural currency over the years. There is a shift towards more entertaining shows rather than 'quality-content', because quality content doesn't bring nearly half as much money as mindless entertainment does. Of course this can change, but it'll be decades before it does.

Also, popular culture has always been a site of contention and argument. Earlier it was 'why do people read so many cheap novels' and 'why do people sit for bawdy shakespearean theatrical performances' and so on. Every cultural moment has it's own background story and ideological reasons that look simple in retrospect but when you're living through them, they're just cause for annoyance. 

Someday, maybe. Till then, finding 'quality' content becomes a niche exercise that demands the effort that it deserves while mass media keeps pushing for content that might not have intellectual currency but makes a shit ton of money. I remember watching spelling bee contests on TV which Soha Ali Khan used to host.Would be pretty cool if we had shows like that on mainstream channels too There are plenty of quizzes, exhibitions and debates happening around, maybe more so than when we were growing up, you need to look at the right place.",2019-03-17 06:46:27

Most of the consumers are working class and like to forget their daily struggle in exchange for something grand, musical, and happy for a few hours.

More serious and mature content is also catching up though, and if you look at the box office numbers, some of the bigger budget films with the bigger stars have not been doing as well as they'd like to.

With Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, even YouTube providing a wide variety of entertainment, it's only a matter of time before a majority of the population gets exposed to better made and thoughtful content, and hopefully become patrons.

Btw, Hollywood has its own share of shit too. Some truly awful cinema.  Entertainment is subjective. 

As simple as that. If your aren't able to understand that, than you are hopeless.  

I’m an aspiring Filmmaker and working on a gangster movie. I pay attention to
The detail and want my movie as realistic as possible. For that I watched back to back violent gritty movies and tv series for inspiration from Chandni Bar, Slumdog Millionaire, Sacred Games, Peaky Blinders, Breaking Bad, Girl in Yellow Boots and so on. I saw documentaries regarding prostitution. somehow it took a toll on me (added to the fact that I had depression and few mental issues). I recently watched Zootopia and Secret Life of Pets on TV. It was purely accidental as I was browsing through channels. Watching it was really refreshing and improved my mood. I was surprised by how my body reacted to feel good movies after a long streak of violent gritty movies. I didn’t know how watching back to back dark movies affected me. I began to think what would be the status of people who have a bad life? People who actually lived or had similar difficult like similar to those movies? It is then I began thinking the other way. Not everyone has privileged life as we do. There are poor people and people with so many misfortunes in life and movies like Race 3 which has foreign locations, catchy songs etc makes them forget their life for 2 hours and so. Commercial cinema is maybe their only way to see foreign exotic locations. Why should they pay money and watch an Anurag Kashyap movie or movies like Slumdog or Chandni Bar? Their life is an Anurag Kashyap movie and they go back to that life once the movie ends. I love realism and I don’t watch movies like Race 3 but I do know for the fact that I am more privileged than many people. India has1.3 Billion people as a major portion of them have poor living conditions or misfortunes. They use movies as escapism. It’s easy for us to boast about our taste in movies because we were educated and had more access to resources. It’s easy to act intellectual behind a keyboard. 

Despite all these 2018 has shown that Bollywood can’t take the audience for granted. Hopefully it will bring some changes but Commercial cinemas will and should co exist with realistic movies.  [removed] Don't like it? Then don't watch it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Maybe stop judging what people enjoy and try pushing for changes in said movies. People always like larger than life entertainment or gossip drama. If you don't, don't watch them. There is plenty of choices. Choose something else to watch. Personally what I want to see in commercial flicks is better handling of female characters and representation of problems in not so tone-deaf way. I want Simmba to beat up goons but I also want him to take steps to make his city safer and punishing the criminals through the system, not take 'revenge'. I want Simmba to help the victims fight against the oppression, not met out 'vigilante justice'. These are the changes I want to see in commercial movies. But I genuinely find these movies as much fun as those that makes you really think or appreciate movies as an artform and I don't want there to be a day where either of these two kinds cease to exist. Isn't all Bollywood aimed at the tasteless, low IQ masses?

It's very difficult to watch most of the crap they make. Oh goddamn elitist moron. Get down of your high horse and listen to the masses. There is no need to reflect but there is a need to put aside your urban entitlement of shitting over everything which you deem unworthy of your cinematic taste. 

 Even the west has tons of reality TV like kardhasians, some ducking season, pawn stars.

Can't really help when the masses are crazy for the cheap low brow entertainment.  This kind of a mentality reeks of naivety and immaturity. I used to be like this too in my early teens.

The issue underlying all of this is ""class"". Films like Simmba, etc. aren't meant for us, it is as simple as that. It's meant for the working class to escape the misery and struggle in their lives. People like us watching and then shitting on these films only makes us assholes. What right do we have to call the media the other classes consume as ""dumb"" ""low IQ"" ""abominations"" (words that have been used in this thread)? These people's tastes and sensibilities aren't due to their conscious choices, it is something that they are born into. You and I would be the same - and enjoy the same kind of cinema - if we had the misfortune of being born into a lower socio-economic strata. 

This will get me lot of shit but, in a way, it is also fair to say that a film like Simmba is as good a film as Badhai Ho. While their scripts, etc, may be miles apart, they both have brought pleasure to an equal number of Indians, albeit from different sections of the society.

Drop this angsty, immature mindset. Rise above. Hoping ""to rid the world of these hideous monstrosities"" only makes you look like every other naive Indian kid on the internet. 

u/seppukuAsPerKeikaku also makes a good point in his comment.  There are good movies ..Ayushmann Khurana did double with Badhaai Ho and Andhadhund .. But to find gold one has to go through trash first. > we as intelligent human beings

That's where you are are wrong I guess :D Big Boss is a bit different because it's meant to be trash and enjoyed by a lot of people for it's trashiness. Basic Economics - Law of supply and demand.  You're the smart one dude. The rest of India is pretty stupid. That's why they watch that shit.  We intelligent human beings are a minority in India. Can do only as much in such a huge population of gullible stupids! > ""we as intelligent human beings""

that is where you got it all wrong my friend.

Try to accept who we TRULY are( not so intelligent human beings who like hideous monstrosities), you'd have lesser disappointments in life. kuch nahi chill maar aur so ja I'm very confused about this.

On one hand - yeah its a fair point that its entertainment. No industry owes it to us to make what we like. It's up to us to consume what we can.

But on the other hand, and this is in relation to the argument about dark shit vs masala stuff, that's not the argument. Tumhari Sulu wasn't dark. The old Golmaal wasn't dark. Badhaai ho wasn't dark. Stree was perfectly okay. They're still entertaining movies that everybody related too. Why should we be okay with absolute baseline mediocrity? But, well, filmmaking is expensive business and people pay for mediocrity. So, yeah. Race 2 is the greatest movie ever made. STFU Watch Jerry Springer? Because.. aankh maarey re ladka aankh maarey... PELVIC THRUST PELVIC THRUST SKIMPY CLOTHED THUMKA SHINY LIGHTS, DESIGNER CLOTHES, PELVIC THRUST SUGGESTIVE LYRICS.  It's not just here. Heard about Human Centepede? /r/iamverysmart As if phenomemon of mindless entertainment is specific to India. 

People enjoy them, let them. Does Big Boss on TV or Race 3 in theatres deny you your type of entertainment? India has a lot of dumb people. Hence Chutiya producers make Chutiya movies for Chutiya people.

Looking for people to discuss it with.

I'd rank this above Sacred Games and that had Nawazuddin Siddiqui in it. It's well shot, extremely well produced and just all around very entertaining to watch. I doubt there is anything else out there which better illustrates what gay people go through in this country on a daily basis.  Watched 2 episodes, everything looks very posh and high profile. Issues addressed so far:

1. Infidelity
2. Betrayal
3. Homosexuality
4. Patriarchy
5. Privacy

Its good drama, bit sleazy IMO. Will finish it this weekend.

PS: Was surprised to see directed by Zoya Akhtar, thought it was just her idea. Late to this discussion. But I really enjoyed the show. Friend of mine had to literally force me to watch the first episode but I was instantly hooked. I love how they use the backdrop of indian weddings to display the hypocrisy in our society. The expression of sunk cost fallacy in the wedding industry is perfectly highlighted. 

They also do a great job showing the stigma related to homosexuality. The friend who introduced it to me would cringe when they showed a gay sex scene . A lot of people would think that hiding your sexuality is simple and people should just be gay in private bit they really open your eyes to the difficulty associated with repressing your sexuality. 

They covered a lot in the first season itself but the story has a lot more to tie up in the next season. The dynamics between the characters is amazing and you can really see how they each have a point at which they break from their usual selves. Yeah. Rajeev Masand was saying that it's really good. Will watch it during Spring break SO GOOD

It was the kind of show that could easily have been over-dramatic and soap-y but the writing was so on point and the acting was beautifully understated so it was a joy to watch. Even the more predictable plot points were interesting because the characters were written so well. I'm interested to see where they'll take it next season.

Bowlers literally are out of options and Mankading which is not at all illegal is seen as an option by several bowlers these days.  No one wants to see logical arguments here.. 

1) you are not allowed to leave the crease before ball is bowled. 

2) if bowler has not loaded his action then he can run the batsman out. 

These 2 rules should be sufficient but I guess people mixing ethics,  sportsmanship with rules. 

Understand..  backing up before ball is bowled is also unethical.  Lol..its a good entertainment in an entertainment circus.  <<Isn't illegal >>

So why ban ?

I am not a cricket fan but if something isn't illegal than there is nothing wrong. If you see the clip, ashwin was waiting for Butler to go out. Deceiving is same as cheating *Jos Buttler Neither BCCI nor ICC can make laws. That is the prerogative of the government, which has no business meddling with cricket rules. Hence, the question of legality is ill posed.  Okay Ashwin was cunt for appealing but the third umpire should've known better because it was referred to him.  Mankading is legal and allowed. However there is something called the spirit of the game. Mankading without any warning is a cunt move, very unsportsmanlike but legal.           



For Ashwin, it is more complicated because if you look at the video from various angles in slo-mo, you can see had he bowled  normally, then at the time ball would leave the hand, Butler would still be in his crease. Ashwin slowed down and waited for Butler to leave the crease to run him out. That makes it a dubious case.              



Banning him is way too harsh. Maybe a fine, maybe. But it was a dick move and he should be ashamed to resort to such tactics because they couldn't get Butler out the normal way. What he did is shameful and totally against the spirit of the game, I wouldn't want him in my team. Banning ashwin means attack against Tamils Its legal.

But you cannot just stop at the point of delivery and wait for the batsman to get out of the crease. This is where Ashwin should be ashamed of himself. 

When Harsha asked him in presentation , if he waited for the batsman to get out ? He replied "" I was not even in the delivery stride. And it was instinctive."" 

Chu bana raha hai kya dunya ko.

  I think it's against the spirit of the game and he should be banned for it. One of my favourite memories of cricket is watching that great gentleman Adam Gilchrist voluntarily walk when he's actually out but given not out by the umpire. That is real cricket.",2019-03-26 07:21:04
Entertainment,How about we don't watch TV at all.,50,am770c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/am770c/how_about_we_dont_watch_tv_at_all/,27,1549086337.0,"I was going through r/india subreddit where I saw many posts regarding the new plan TRAI has proposed. And overall Channel cost being higher than previous scheme.

But what if we don't watch TV at all and encourage others  because We All Know They are selling propaganda afterall. Every channel has their own agenda.There is not a single quality '30 minute programme.' I might be exaggerating but I can say this for about 80% of TV.

I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs  online for a very low fees. 

These are my 2 cents on the situation about how we can tackle it.
I know my fellow redditors will have questions. I will try to answer their questions.
",UnhatchedEgg," \+1

It's for this reason I haven't watched a news show I think since the Nirbhay movement. Everything is measured by TRP and clicks, not by good outcomes for everyone.  Cut my cable back in Jan last year and got a Chromecast..its much better.. planning to get a mi box as it has more features While we ourselves may not watch Tv,  there are still millions whose only source of entertainment is the tv. 

My grandma would kill me if I take the tv away from her.  >I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs online for a very low fees.

Not everyone has access to unlimited high-speed internet. I live in a tier 2 city and I am finding it hard to give up on DTH and solely rely on the internet for streaming. Now think about those who are living in rural or remote areas or are not technologically savvy enough. It is not as easy as you are making it out.  6 years + here. Got feed up with mindless ads and 3rd class content. I do have all channels cause wife and mom. But me personally, I don't even know what to watch on TV lol. Used to be interested in news but there's nothing left there. 

So when I have absolutely nothing to do and I am tired of Netflix, YouTube, amazon prime, reddit... I turn on the TV, keep changing the channels for about 2 minutes and turn it off  Stopped watching. The most peaceful 1.5 yrs. Cable connection in my home is just for my grandma's shows. Okay some are saying they use Cable only because of their families. That's alright in my opinion. 
But atleast we can encourage our generation and younger generation who think they've got no other source of entertainment. Had been more than a year that I got rid of TV... Don't even own one now...have got so much free time now that I spend on improving myself. Where can we watch sports online for low fee? Amazon Prime Video ₹999

Hotstar Annual Sub    ₹999

Netflix(4 Person)         ₹200

SonyLiv                          Free

Much better than any cable pack you might subscribe to.  I haven't had a cable connection since 2014. Never missed it for a minute  I don't watch TV at all since school days. We were in boarding school and had no tv. College days there was no time. These days whole of the entertainment is online. I made the mistake of opening tv few times, what a bunch of crap that passes for a news, tv serial, reality shows etc, utter crap. The crap that we have on Indian tv will fall flat in front of any cable content from other countries. About time they think through how to make serials, news , reality shows, etc because newer generation of people simply aren't interested in watching TV at all. It's all about internet. Simple YouTube channels and news articles on the internet have better content than big media houses. And then comes these Netflix, Amazon prime, hulu type services that produces awesome content that people actually pay to see and can see it anytime any episode anywhere.  Wish I could tell this to my parents but TV is the only thing they have for entertainment so I really don't wanna screw with that [removed] [removed] I dont even watch TV since 3-4 years.Its my grandparents who are TV fanatics. Someone please explain that to my mum and dad who keep the effing TV and that set-top-box for absolutely no reason. Redditors please put forth your points to aid me I haven't watched actual TV in over 15 years.. ever since I left home for college. Couldn't really watch in college, and after I left college, I stuck to movies and TV shows from the internet. 

I tried watching a few times but was astounded by the sheer number of ads. Also, the fact that you have essentially a very limited choice at any given moment, and you have to wait for the show you want is too bad. I'm surprised TV has lasted so long. Maybe it's there for the older people and for news and sports. ",2019-02-02 11:15:37

Sports,The incomplete end of an era.,1406,cc7zis,https://i.redd.it/yduuz9txxt931.jpg,119,1562947428.0,,rgaywala," Credits : Krishna Rathi

Original Post can be found on his Instagram handle : rathikrishna42 Is it really an incomplete end of the era? The man literally won everything there is to win in the game as captain, not even as just a player.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn’t do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it’s sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it’s due. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals. Not incomplete and no end either. 

As a batsman he has slowed down in terms of power hitting but Pandya/ Pant will take over that front (which they should have in the semifinals). He is still as good a batsman you'll get for No 4/ 5, still a fast runner and lighting quick behind the wicket. Like for Federer it's the outsiders who are waiting for the retirement non-stop.

It is Ravi Shastri we need to bid goodbye to and move on. Some people move on Am I the only one who read 'DHOR' 🙆 No its not incomplete. He gave us Worldcup, worldcup 20 20, champion trophies, he is the most successful Indian criket captain in History. He is complete, his era is complete. He will deserve farewell like Sachin whenever he want to retire Its not the end. He will still play in T20 WC. Sorry I read it as Dhor first r/DesignPorn Incomplete? Bro which world are you living in? Or do you have amnesia. He has won everything that had to be won in cricket. Only captain with T20 World Cup, 50 Over World Cup & Champions Trophy. Pardon my language but fuck you for your stupid creative. It's because of ungrateful people who call themselves fans just like you that these cricketers are put under so much pressure to always perform. What have you done in your own uneventful life? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever completed anything worthy for generations to come? You bro, are shit. There's little or no worth to your existence. I am no Dhoni fanboy but your creative is just dumb, tone deaf and utterly mistaken. Thoda jyada ho gaya [deleted] Wonderful creativity. *an era How you say incomplete Bar bar yaad mat dilao yr. Seriously guys there is no fairy tale ending in life. He got out doing what he did best and that is all that matters. People want everything to be a bollywood movie. I don't think that Dhoni has to rely on some armchair critic telling him how his career was incomplete. He has achieved a lot already. I have myself not been a huge fan of keeping him in the team for the past 6 months, but you have to be foolish to think his career is incomplete. Dhoni is not retiring.

He's not. Okay!? Out of the loop here. Can anyone tell me what exactly happened?

I didnt watch the world cup that's why. Thats how Karma bites you... [deleted] Why tf is everyone saying end of an era? He hasn't even slightly hinted at retiring anytime soon. Is this the doing of his haters? It’s not the end. He s gonna hang around Bhai rulaega kya? No worries, he will be there (next worldcup) HOPE [deleted]",2019-07-12 21:33:48

Edit: PS. Found one reason. She goes on the cover of Cosmopolitan and also delivers a gold from a foreign city. Literally keeping her head in the game. I was thinking to go to her wiki page but Akshay Kumar will anyways make a movie on this in few months and sell desh bhakti . What's the latest on her controversy regarding testosterone levels? Is she one of those affected by the recent rulings regarding Caster Semenya? Proud feeling Proud of India I love the initiative of posting non-cricket news... kudos! Her coach told her, just before the race...


""New rule Dutee... If any of the big ones catch you, they are allowed to eat you... Have fun."" Anushka and virat is important bro.. Lesbians have to learn to run faster to save their lives from trishool fanatics Splitting sports on gender lines creates complexities like this. If any of her competitors were given testosterone in the amounts she naturally produces, during their puberty, they would probably blow her away.  Same issue with Castor from South Africa.

The question becomes, what is the relevance of being a female athlete when gender is fluid. Can we allow a very effeminate man who identifies as a woman to compete in women’s sports?

Recently there was some news about how top World Cup female soccer teams had been dominated by third tier men’s teams. This is another aspect of the absurdity. If women are insulated from competition from males, because males have unfair levels of testosterone, then shouldn’t they also be insulated from other individuals who have high testosterone regardless of those individual’s self declared gender identification?

Edit: look at that photo. Does it feel fair to arbitrarily allow someone with that much testosterone to compete with women who don’t have that advantage? And if we don’t split on testosterone lines, then why even have gendered sports? Doesn't she have XY chromosomes though? Unfair competition. Indian Athletics and any non Cricket sport deserves more publicity in India. But that said, I don't understand why r/India gets so excited about Indians winning in 3rd tier events in which the top athletes sit out. There are at least 10 women in the world under the age of 20 that can beat her time. And if she ran at the NCAA outdoor championships, she wouldn't even make it out of the prelims with her personal best. Her time of 11.24 would be good for 12th best.The university games are not even on the average American college athletes' radar. That's why these type of events get very little media coverage. I'm gay for her. But I'm a man. She is gay dutee chand. lol. what were her parents smoking before deciding on that name?",2019-07-10 16:51:47

Cool. Congrats girls! This is awesome!

It must've been quite a journey for these athletes to compete in an almost unheard of sport (in this country)

I'm glad to see so many more sports come into the limelight in the recent years. Kabadi and football come to mind. Wow! Never knew this sport was played and practised in India. That too at such a high level.

Must have been some struggle for these girls to reach that stage. Hope stuff like this gets more coverage and support in the future.

Congratulations! You girls are the real deal. The fact that some of us didn't even know we had a rugby team shows how unsupportive India is in sports except for cricket. Our gold medal athletes struggle to live while other countries treat them like any other celebrity Strange to see it's a French Bank sponsoring them. Why can't some Indian firms try to sponsor them too. Really proud of their win We even have Rugby🏉 team... Woo...😯 Congratulations! You all are awesome! As a NZ Indian, this warms my heart. Growing up in a semi rural town, rugby and cricket were the most popular sports by far. Love this! And yes, I played rugby in primary school and also intermediate. I was about to comment ""woah we have a rugby team ?"" But most of the comments are same because all we care about cricket and 2 3 other major games and such games are very underrated even govt does not gives shit about any other games besides 3-4 games. We are mentally breaking the these players atleast we have to cheer about them too.
Congrats. Proud of u ladies. Congratulations 🎊 Awesome stuff!!! There is an Indian WOMEN’s rugby team  😳 Heartily congratulations girls.

 There's more to sport than cricket !!  Congratulations! Great news... another sport to look into. We leads in cricket and hockey and now I'm Rugby. Hope that continues.

And BTW the growth of Indian football should lead Indian team into world cup. We should defund cricket, its not even an Olympic sport. Those parasites just each butter chicken everyday. We should help support the people actually bringing glory to our nation. Indian women team in rugby as well .. that's just awesome! More power to women !!

I would like you to write the review again and screenshot it before they remove it again. Post that here too. >Delivery guy ran away with food.

I am sorry, but I laughed out loud reading this. OP, you're an idiot, and you don't know how to deal with issues. If the tracking did say the order was picked up and then there was no response, how the hell can you call it ""Delivery guy ran away with food?"" I'm calling you an idiot because you keep repeating that exact phrase in this thread as if you saw him running away with your food. It could have been an issue with the restaurant where they they couldn't fulfill your order hence fake processed it until the tracking starts. Someone else near your house could have taken it from the delivery guy because free food. Whatever, learn how to state your problem correctly. Mention only the things that you know for sure.

> ""I haven't received my food, and the delivery person is not receiving my calls. I was tracking the order and I witnessed the order being picked up and the delivery person moving towards my address, but I have not got my food yet.""

Not:

> My order was picked up and the delivery guy ran away with it

> This is the truth

I'm sure you would have said something similar in the Zomato review, and that is why your review was removed. Ordered Dry Manchurian from Zomato. Received fried onions. Called the restaurant & he said ""Sir, manchurian khatam ho gaya tha!"" Messaged Zomato Support. Initially said no for refund. After 15 minutes of my asking to call me or transfer to somebody senior, gave me a refund. Actually this might have gotten Zomato in legal trouble(even though they would easily win, they don't even want to take chances of litigation). You claimed  (i believe you personally) that the restaurant committed a crime so that can have serious legal consequences. My restaurant consistently gets 4 or 5 star ratings on Zomato, and still our rating shows as 3.7 on the site. Super buggy, super rigged even for restaurants. Allegations are bad stuff on reputation based systems.

When it’s an information/social system it’s worse. Either it’s too easy to mass produce allegations and destroy competitors, or it’s too easy to generate reviews and game the system.

To stop this, people end up watching their review pages like hawks, and clean up anything they can, in any way they can. There was no delivery guy. The restaurant made an empty claim and you hallucinated that there was a delivery guy. What I understand is you didn't see the delivery guy ran off but he did mark the delivery as fulfilled. You should be writing the events as you saw in app. Not infer that the agent ran away. It becomes a bold allegation and hence removed. 

The restaurant is certainly at fault for the failure, maybe their modus operandi. But your allegations are definitely unsubstantiated. Please write to us the review, maybe censor any privacy-related names of the restaurant and your locality.

Also, the review on Zomato seems as if it was removed by Zomato, not the Restaurant. Try sending the review again. Shukr manao biwi ke saath nahi bhaaga How do you know it an employee of the restaurant?.

Can you actually prove that someone from the restaurant stole your food?.

Unless and until you have solid proof, it is an allegation. 

Zomato is right is removing your allegation. 

You can't go around throwing claims you cant prove on their website. 

The business can sue Zomato for causing a ""loss of reputation"". Rewrite review. Take screenshot of that and this and post it on twitter tagging zomato. Zomato has been manipulating reviews, ratings and listings since a while now. 

Quite a few top reviewers and regular members are paid / given perks to shape a review a particular way. 

Zomato hike up ur ranking and rating if u buy a paid package

Zomato downs rating of restaurants that are popular with people and generate organic orders but do not comply with zomato 'policies' or 'promotion packages'

Their sales team approaches establishment owners with promotion 'packages' every now and then

I have a few friends who own restaurants and pubs and this shit has been goin on since the last 4 years now, that I know of.

A friend has a micro brewery , the beer and the food is below average, a few years back he bought one such promotion package from zomato and all those positive reviews really drove up the sales. 
Its still a joke in our group, as to how it helped change the footfall of that place and how still none of us go to drink there. The beer and food still sucks, but the place does business coz herd mentality zindiabad ;) What did u write again? I've had this similar incident happened to me. honestly, zomato's delivery service is really bad, i use that just for the reviews and order from swiggy. Lol, ye Delhi vala bakeburry hai kya? People get paid to write fake reviews for around Rs. 300. One e. g. is MPL app.. Check it for yourself.. The last time my  food went 'missing' - left the restaurant but disappeared midway, the zomato care rep flirted with me for over an hour . But in the end, she had to still send that 8 pc bucket of KFC. Saw this yesterday... 

https://twitter.com/FergusonTime/status/1146450505012568064

I deleted my account few months ago on Zomato when they were hacked. Never trusted them. Never liked them. I am more than happy to post my own reviews on Google Maps. In which city/town is this? Asking because I am an avid Zomato user so I like tracking its service. Edit 1: I tried to write the review for the order and it says that the order wasn’t serviced by Zomato and hence refund has been initiated. Which means I’m no longer allowed to review an order which I officially haven’t been served. Almost reminds of chicken and egg story. I want to write a review because I didn’t get the order delivered. In my original review I had even praised Zomato for initiating the refund immediately. Edit 2: https://imgur.com/gallery/AH9qSqg

Food,Why is food allergies less prevelant in India?,43,cc7yq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cc7yq8/why_is_food_allergies_less_prevelant_in_india/,74,1562947238.0,"Whenever I see America the food allergies are so much widespread. 
Peanuts are not allowed in school. All package good and restaurants must have allergy warnings while I have never known a Indian person having food allergies .Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?",devgrv," Our immune responses are different from theirs. Moreover, genetics is a great factor that helps us. 

If you introduce children early on (till about 5 years) to allergenic foods, their chances of developing allergy later is reduced.

I'm no expert, do correct me if I'm wrong. Bhai Yahaan jise jo milta hai woh kha lete hain There are way less autoimmune here as well. Read hygeine hypothesis or biome theory. Mostly cause of the conditions a baby is brought up in. 

Americans do spend a lot of time wiping surfaces with antibacterial wipes and stuff, making the child less immune.

Don't really need to explain our case Hum Gareeb desh hain. Yeh sab allergies are first-world issues! >Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?   

lack of awareness does not cause allergies.    

Indians breathe in dirty air, drink dirty water, eat roadside food that's made with unhygienic stuff with unclean hands, there's utter lack of sense of hygiene here. those plastic disposable gloves you see at restaurants: those are namesake. staff scratch their hair, and whatnot while wearing the same gloves. they are just to keep their hands clean. not to keep our food clean.  we do not have allergies coz we are used to these things. we do not get loose toos after eating street food coz our bodies are immune to those germs.   
have you seen friends / relatives that were eating all filthy roadside food here, and then stayed abroad for 18months and come back for a visit , eat idli sambar and get diarrhea ? coz their immune system has gone weak thanks to the sterile environment in Amrikka. Because Indians have been eating all kinds of potentially allergic food since time immemorial, and natural selection has done  what it does best. The thing that does not kill you only  makes you stronger. I'm allergic to shellfish. Indians are least fussy about this. The only thing you will get warnings about is egg and meat. Maybe because some allergies are hereditary. They are too damn clean. Children aren’t supposed to grow in a sanitized environment. I'm allergic to eggs😕 I remember reading a study where they proposed this theory that unsanitary conditions during childhood actually helps in preventing these allergies. They proved some link between gut bacteria and the allergies I think. Can't find it now. Indians have become mutant, immune to Farzi diseases like allergies. 30 percent Indians are lactose intolerant 

People don't know what they are allergic of Can't just be awareness. If you're not aware of your peanut allergy you become aware in a hurry. Maybe children not raised in a clinically clean environment get less allergies? I have a notion, but because large agricultural companies often pay for the ""science"" to verify the safety of their products and work hard to silence those who disagree, this is difficult to prove. However, I'm of the belief that the increasing pesticides and GMOs adversely affect gut health tied to allergy issues. The most common allergens are tied to industries with the most pesticides: corn, wheat, soy, and peanuts, to name a few. Food allergies were not that widespread in America, and it's only been on the uptick coincidentally around the same time as the higher prevalence of GMOs and heavy pesticides. Agriculture was nowhere near consolidated in the hands of a few as it is today. 

&#x200B;

It kinda makes sense because GMO foods and pesticides are both designed with the goal of rupturing an insect's stomach. Given the genetic similarities between humans and even the lowly fruitfly, I don't know how we can all be surprised that humans experience food allergies, IBS, leaky gut, and a number of other problems from eating the same foods designed to kill insects. Americans eat allot of processed foods. Also there is an over reliance on drugs... allergy is reaction of body that is fighting something it deems risky for your immune system.

Indians generally eat everything from a very early age. so our body gets used to all kind of stuff and also the hygiene angle comes in. Our immune gets used to some germs. We are immune but our next generation might face it. Thanks to our new fad diet and water. There is a theory that when peanut allergies started showing up in america the doctors advised pregnant women to stop eating all kinds of nuts immediately.

Years later it was observed that nut allergies suddenly grew disproportionatly. 

Also a large number of allergy cases can be minimised and eradicated with continuous controlled exposure.

As for Indians.... You can't really actively avoid anything coz everything is adulterated and contaminated.",2019-07-12 21:30:38
Food,Online food delivery apps Zomato and Swiggy have much to thank India’s small towns for,125,cf3lw2,https://scroll.in/article/930862/in-charts-who-leads-the-race-between-zomato-and-swiggy-and-where,22,1563543285.0,,Mizark123," Living in a tier 2 city at present. One of the reasons these apps are so popular here probably is because while the food in the restaurants is decent, the ambiance is terrible at most restaurants. It's much more comfortable to order food and eat at home. The discounts also help. A dish costing 300 rs in a restaurant costs 240 rs if I order from swiggy. Sometimes crunchiness or freshness takes a hit, but when it doesn't, online food ordering is wonderful. The bandwagon effect is too damn prevalent in Hyderabad. Take any fucking thing, once fire catches, everyone would be doing the same thing. Everyone watches the same comedy shows, everyone watches the same movies, everyone goes to 'ram ki bandi' at 12am and everyone visits Charminar in the night to feel they're the 'cool' guys.

Everyone seems to be using swiggy now. My 8 year old nephew, my >50 year old parents inclu. I know many college kids who now deliver on swiggy for pocket money, and the next day they'd ordering from swiggy to spend that money. It's so funny. They don't deliver to my place. 😞 How is Hyderabad a Tier-2 city? I am from a small town. A suburb of Mumbai though. Swiggy & Zomato do not even provide service here. Now we have our own exclusive app. Almost spent 7-8k on online food orders , people are becoming more lazy and eating more outside food without even going out.  
this will lead to more health issues as we all know about the hygiene standards and ingredients at restaurants.",2019-07-19 19:04:45

Shut up and take my money!! If the food is good, why not. [deleted] I thought jail chapattis were already popular in Kerala. Any other state with this kinda jail food popularity? We have a central prison in our district. Their chappatis are so popular (and cheap) we place bulk orders for parties and marriage functions. This reminds of the days back when I was in my hometown. There's a central prison in it and its prisoners used to grow vegetables and sell them to the general public. A real ""Kaidi Kitchen"" For those who are concerned with profiteering.

The money goes back to the upkeep and expansion of the kitchen, ingredients, and wages to the prisoners. The wages are quite low around 100 Rs per day IIRC and for good reason. They have been doing it for more than a decade I think. In Trivandrum at first, they used to send vans to places around the city where the policemen would sell food packets. Usual spots would be around Government hospitals. They expanded the program to start vegetable farms and poultry farms within the jail. They also started a restaurant next to the prison, which is very popular. This is just an extension of services since Swiggy and Ubereats have expanded rapidly in Kerala. Huh. The more you know. Would love to taste it. There is a good chance that one of those inmates is doing time for poisoning someone's food. No thanks.",2019-07-11 00:21:02

I live in a hosel and eat mostly from my office canteen or from outside. I'm spending more than 250 bucks a day and still my calorie intake barely cross 2000. There are no facilities to cook where I stay nor do I get the time to.

Can anyone provide suggestions?",azorahai7," You can drink Sattu everyday. If you are drinking it from the road it will cost you 10 Rupees. If there are no Sattu vendor then you can buy them online or from a store (a small packet costs 25 Rupees, will last 2 glasses. So 1 glass=12.5 Rupees). Search Google or YouTube for tutorial about how to make it (spoiler: you will have to add onions, chilli, black paper in that drink)

A glass of Sattu has approximate 327 calories, low fat and 27 grams of protein. It is 100% organic and natural. It also keeps you full for a long time. It's very popular in Bihar, West Bengal, Nepal etc and especially among labourers because it's cheap and gives instant energy.

I'm in the same boat. Trying to gain weight and build some muscle. But I can't afford any supplement. So I drink one glass of this Desi drink everyday (hoping to drink 2 now), the results have been satisfying so far. Of that 2500, what's your preferred breakdown in terms of protein/carbs/fat and what are you getting right now? Peanut butter hands down, but only if you like the taste. Banana shake? Chicken 65 Peanuts.

A 50g Haldiram Salted Peanuts costs 10/- and has more than 300 calories and its too tasty. You can easily much 3-4 packets a day :-) Peanuts have high protein content too, which would help in muscle building too. Basically peanut butter smoothies with whey protein, one extra meal a day, Greek yogurt when you feel hungry. You also need to workout more intensely. I guess Upma is calorie rich with the ghee and all? Blend 100gm oats, one big scoop of peanut butter, one big banana and 250ml milk(or soy milk if you can't take milk). Add curd/yogurt if you want. That should get you close to 600+ calories. Visit /r/gainitmeals for more such shakes. Eat fried things and lots of sugar and fat stuff.",2019-07-21 21:59:05

I used to give her roti, milk etc every day twice a day since her mother brought her out from the dry drain shelter (in which she had given birth). In about a month or two, the puppy was in good health and a rich black shiny fur. But then she (puppy) died suddenly. Something happened to her and she didn't eat for 2 days and died on the 3rd. Her death affected me so much emotionally, I was surprised. So I have decided not to own a dog, because I just can't imagine the grief when a dog dies (naturally) after 10-15yrs.

(My bday is not in July. Or anywhere nearby. Just recalling) Last night in Goa! What a premium grown up trip I had! So I am going through arrange marriage process and I will use this thread to post my daily updates, if that is okay.

I am 30, M. I work in IT. Never had a GF. Two years ago, I was deeply infatuated with a close friend of mine and she said no when I expressed my feelings. I was depressed for a while, but somehow got better. I still have my bad days. But, from that point on I have become socially awkward. I can't hold a conversation, properly at all. Sometimes, I go blank and I don't know what to say. This never used to happen with me earlier!

Signed up on Matrimony sites and I got soooo many matches/interests. That actually felt good, lol. 

So I was talking with a girl, my first match and turns out she uses reddit too. We had a nice convo around for an hour and that was the longest convo I could have, after that incident. Come next day, I was not able to talk at all. I was able to see that she was putting effort and trying to make better for me. But, for how long? Next day I messaged her, but same stuff. I apologised to her and lied her this is not working for some reason. This was 3 months back. 

Next stories / meetups have also been same. But I will tell them about later! Finally going for further education after a year and half. Looking forward to this! Going to sleep, fuck you all. Yesterday i learnt that if somebody compliments you, you compliment them back and never pop medicines without prescription. Any good vape eliquid websites ? 
And good eliquid which you are aware of ? Goodnight and kiss to u/ssj_cule College 1st year is going to start from next month, hope I can have fun. 

On a sadder note, I am still depressed and I dont know if it will go away or not. :( *रे धीरे धीरे चुनरी सरकने लगी*

*थोडा क्लोज तो आजा बेबी मुखड़ा दिखाजा*

*बिना पीते ही यारों मुझे तो चढ़ने लगी* So i went out to do some work today. Near a bus stop i saw a mildly packed bus. In the last seat, the last window [behind the last woman reserved seat] i saw a girl and a boy. Barely 4-5 years younger than me [say first second year of college]. In that packed bus i saw the the boy bending slightly to the front and turn to the girl and go in and the girl reciprocated and landed a kiss on the boy's lips. Then the boy went further low and landed a kiss on the girls left boob. All this within 2 seconds. 

I laughed slightly at the young kids' experience of love but just then fear grasped me. What if anyone else saw? What if other other people grab hold of them and start beating them? I know Kolkata is not an idiotic cow belt city but even here sometimes these arent accepted by the old farts [remember the couple beaten in Kolkata Metro last year?]

I then questioned the very point of India, where people cant even live and love without fear.

>In the first phase, the plan is to sell biriyani combo online, priced at Rs 127.

>The  combo, which was specifically designed for online sale, includes 300  grams of biriyani rice, one roasted chicken leg piece, three chappathis,  a cup cake, salad, pickle and one litre bottled water along with a  plantain leaf to eat the food, authorities at the Viyyur central jail,  where it is being prepared.

Plus so much food in just 127 bucks? F\*\*\*\*\*g A! If they are trying to launch a commercial business out of it, I hope they are paying the inmates wages equivalent to what they would get outside for a similar job. I also hope that part of the profit goes towards development within the prison. I've tried these prison made foods. They are very very nice and cheap. I hope this works out properly A great idea! But I'm not so sure about jail hygiene, from what I have heard about conditions in jail. Brilliant. Getting them to work. I don't understand why anybody can think this is a good idea. Looking at prison labor as profit is a dangerous slippery slope, not to mention that the laborers are being denied the fruits of their labor. This is highly unethical. No one should make money from prison or prisoners. If you don't want to waste the products prisoners create, give them for free. Good way to smuggle stuff. > The state prison department is also considering a proposal to open  portals of one of its central jails for common people to spend a day and  night there to get the ‘feel’ of jail life by charging a fee.

Food,I think I'm gonna get rich if I sell all the ketchup packets that I receive with online food orders every month.,141,c87456,https://i.redd.it/glwf6dx8zu731.jpg,39,1562088315.0,,ppatra," Will be useful when you run out of ketchup. I used to collect them, until I realized they have a short shelf life. Check their expiry date before storing them. You spend 300 bucks on a food order and get two packets. How are you going to get rich.

ULPT: You can instead walk into these stores during rush hours and pretend to be a customer and ask for extra ketchup Those are rookie numbers. You need to pump those numbers up in this business. and yes I tell them specifically to not to send ketchup packets.. but they still do. 😭 Rs.15/- S T O N K S! Your going to get rich if you stop buying and start making at your home Sounds good, doesn't work Given how much you spend on eating outside, you won't be. Arey Sandeep Patra ji🤣 No u won't so which one is better? Yea, sure. Bro, what is your weight btw??😉 A bit off topic but this type of packaging is exactly the stuff that ends up in ocean. Since it's small piece of single use plastic you can't recycle nor easy to landfill. Very easy to enter the ecosystem after consumption by birds etc. Bhai itna bahar ka mat kha. Not good for you. You need to stop ordering food and learn to cook. Cheaper than starting a business..lol.",2019-07-02 22:55:15
Food,Food apps scam spread the word,576,br8ypj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/br8ypj/food_apps_scam_spread_the_word/,261,1558465086.0,"1)
Hi I own a restaurant and I just wanted to bring it to light to all of you. That your food is expensive because. Of these. Companies they charge Us a 25 percent commission on every order we get for eg  a burger for 250 minus commission  is 200 on top of that these restaurant ending discounts brings the value down even further for eg. The 40 percent discount  of Zomato is running will cost. Me another 50-70 rupees I would end up selling the burger for  130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants And local businesses  
2)
They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 35  to 25 rupee  for the delivery per order Zomato is earning  almost 100 ruppes from you and me I understand its a business you need profits but the discounts they are running will shut. Your favourite.  Small time businesses very soon 

Tldr- Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !


I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language its actually one of the few times I've written in English that to such a long topic hope you understand !

Last edit - I do not run a burger place :p I own a south Indian chain but the example of a burgers was a rough example to make you guys understand !",Bluebaleno," Did zomato ask you before putting discount on your food? > The 40 percent discount of Zomato is running will cost. Me another 50-70 rupees I would end up selling the burger for 130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants And local businesses

Can you explain why restaurants are bearing the discount that Zomato is giving, when Zomato is supposed to bear the discount provided by them? Update
 Some of you have some common questions which I will answer

As for source simply call Zomato ask them you want to sign with them what's the contract they offer it. Will not be below 25% 

People saying without them I would not have orders that far its true but I before they started their own delivery (Zomato) my boys would go 7-8 kilometers for even a order worth 160  Zomato use to be a website to look for restaurants you could not order my boys since. Then have been going for 7-8. Kilometers 

Lastly to end this topic Zomato is soon making a place where you would have to buy your raw. Materials from them only which is known as hyperpure which. Will become mandatory to buy from according to my account manager if we want to work with them even Swiggy is buying. Spaces taking restaurants. Under that space and selling the restaurants item under Swiggys name  as someone who's been  in the industry for 12. Years you can choose to believe me or the company but if it continues the way it is many for your favorite places will shutdown thanks guys for hearing me out its been a tough year for restaurants ! > Tldr- Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

Cheating is strong word. They aren't cheating anyone but a lot of their business practice is outright predatory. 

Don't restuarant owners have unions? If not, you guys should unionize and negotiate better deals with these companies. In Zomato and Swiggy's war for customerbase, small businesses suffer. It's the same thing with Uber taxis; they scam the taxi drivers by charging large commissions off an already low taxi fare. Also restaurant owners send half filled boxes when people apply such discounts to make up the loss, so you both are riding the same boat. 

I'hv noticed this numerous times in different cities, try vising the restaurant and getting parcel in person, you'll notice they'll use smaller sized packages while sending food via zomato. OP, let me tell you how to solve this problem but you'll have to become a little tech savvy for that! 

In Pune, there is a restaurant called ""Behrouz Biryani"" who were facing similar problem as yours, let me tell you how they solved it. I used to order biryani from there through Zomato. When I repeatedly ordered biryani about 4-5 times, they texted me a special offer: If I purchased through **their** app in the Play Store (instead of Zomato), they'll give me an additional whopping 20% discount compared to the present price!

I figured out they must be facing the same issue as yours. Zomato, the middle man must be eating all their profits through discounts and delivery charges but if they (Behrouz Biryani) had their own app in the Play Store, people will order directly from there and they can be offered a much better price now. They'll have to arrange logistics but it should be trivial if you are running an established restaurant for a long time.

Try that OP, app development is not that difficult these days. Catch a trustworthy techie and either he'll code it himself for you, or he'll know a freelancer friend who'll do it. The future belongs to those who know how to ace the technological race. We know. Most of us still order for the convenience. The argument put forth could be that Zomato/Swiggy are bringing you new customers that would otherwise never visit your restaurant in person, and so any business is good business, no matter how small the margins may be.

However, on further thinking, the food app economy is killing the ""lets go out for dinner"" economy. So less customers over time will choose to visit your restaurant and prefer ordering online, which will cut into your normal profits, and limit your ability to maintain rent/electric etc costs of running a physical restaurant.

I think the end-game is to have every outlet on Zomato/Swiggy eventually turn into a kitchen-front only, working on minimal margins, with the 'middle-man' taking most of the profit, just for providing what used to be a free service (Menus + calling restaurants for delivery). Similar findings could be made in the Uber/Ola economy etc. 

Sad, but this is late stage capitalism at work. Please stop supporting Zomato. I was at a roll stall yesterday and I asked the seller about how Zomato earns as a middleman-service when you're the one charging for service and the customer is paying to you. He explained it to me and I was like, ""So how does it benefit you if they charge you money?"". He said, ""They bring us work."". I was like, ""Do they?"". And he responded, ""No, not really. We're making the same as before, except now Zomato takes away a portion of our earnings."" Hi OP, a quick question for you.

Let's say you're selling a burger via swiggy for 140 (MRP)
If I were to eat at your restaurant, will I be charged the same? What's the cost of an in-store customer versus one who orders via Swiggy or Zomato? If I order online, you save money you otherwise incur on sitting space, electricity, waiter charges, etc..

Don't you think when you account for all this, the money you lose to commissions and discounts on Swiggy/Zomato is same as what you would incur on an in-store customer? The business model is based on optimistic high volume sales.

Yes i believe this stupid 30% 10% loss bearing system should go away. But this model also gets you a higher number of orders, which otherwise you were supposed to rely on your loyal customers.
So if you were selling 10 burgers to your ""loyal"" customers and were earning 10 ₹ per burger.
Not you're obviously selling atleast 20+ burgers at maybe 5₹ profit, plus the customers who walk into your restaurant.

And moreover, its consistent earning. Its a win win situation, if there is a better loss bearing system. 

And restaurant owners also send stale, unedible, low quantity, half orders etc food which on our complaint zomato bears the refund cost. So, i dont think its only zomato's fault if people keep looking to earn money by fraud methods. Which part is a scam and how are they cheating the customer? Is it the commission they charge you or the discount which is passed on to the clients or the delivery fee they are charging?

I am sorry if this comes across as rude but if you are setting up a business relying on a 3rd party to drive orders then you can't say they are scamming you if you don't make as much money as them. A restaurant near my place stuck to their guns and had their own delivery service. They are doing quite well. If there's a restaurant union near your place, pool in some money and start your own online delivery service. You don't need stuff like fancy GPS tracking systems. A good payment gateway and order delivering on time will suffice. I often order food online (Swiggy) and the shit they pull off with the discounts is outright shady. They'll inflate the prices, give discount and bring the total bill to the same price as it was earlier. 

Also, I was at this restaurant a few days ago. I frequently order chicken 65 from this restaurant which is priced around 170 (if you buy directly from the restaurant) and 210 (if you order from Swiggy), so what I've realized is that Swiggy not only inflates the prices but also adds taxes, packaging charges, and delivery charges which knocks up the price to almost 250 which makes no sense. I used to work at an F&B SaaS company/startup. They make website for the restaurant (with their branding and theme and all), where customer can directly place the order (Restaurant get better margin, and they can offer reasonable discount). 

The competition of Swiggy and Zomato had really killed the business from their website almost for most of the clients.

&#x200B;

Burger King used to run a lot of discount on their website, but had dropped their website for ordering completely. Indian mentality is cheap and wants discounts everywhere. 

I will legitimately give more money to apps to click and order instead of talking on the phone for ordering and haggling with the delivery person for change. Tell me straightforward.

What is the % net margin on your business? Can you put together more facts and figures  to help use understand the issue ?

Also, doesnt these apps increase the number of orders for your restaurant ? How do you factor that in ? Huh, for a year now I've been noticing that a plate of Mutton Biryani from well-known and popular joints, here in Chennai (like Buhari, Dindigul Thalapakatti etc...) have priced it around Rs.270-290 or so. Prior to that it used to be around the Rs. 180-220 range (depending on the restaurant). Sure, the prices of other dishes might have obviously been hiked too, but as for now, this is what's coming in my mind.

Is the increase in price have to do with what OP has posted here? Or is it just normal and typical (due to inflation and all) and I'm just overstating things here? 

But, (nearly) 300rs for a plate of Mutton Biryani is just ridiculous, especially for the portion size that is provided to us, imo. Do you think going for a online only restaurant might help reduce your costs. You will be able to rent some small space for just the kitchen, and it doesn't have to be in the main road.

I remember reading that these type have kitchens have started becoming popular in US. Are there such kitchens operating in India now. Guess it’s Uber Cheats Just curious, do u prepare Zomato/Swiggy/Uber Eats orders differently from when a customer orders directly from you or eats in your restaurant? Thanks op. I have heard that now they are opening their own kitchen , they would make high selling food items which are high in demands , its brilliant not having to maintain a shop and just a kitchen when can be at a strategic place in city and on whatever place or floor they want and i have heard they are going to recommend their own Kitchen food since it would be tremendously cheaper since absolutely no or minimal working cost is associated with it , but this is very unjust for all the restaurant business owners because they will finally lose those who actually started using the platform because of the restraunts customers and they certainly can't compete in terms of cost to an outlet specially​ enhanced for online order . Its clearly very Injustice to everyone I may be late to comment on this but I after with OP that zomato earns around 100rs per order . According to one calculation of mine at my local Chinese food stall zomato was earning 40% apart from delivery charges and all. Some restaurants in my area are not on zomato or swiggy they are old restaurants and they get a decent footfall from their loyal customers. 

One restaurant/dhaba I used to go frequently. Bcos of good food and fast service was almost empty in what used to be a rush hour. Out side of it was a number of delivery boys waiting for the orders. I feel people coming to restaurants was more profitable for restaurants then people ordering. I always wondered who is paying the discount % to the restaurant


I noticed the price hike as well, earlier the price of jeera rice was 150, after a week or 2 it hiked to 230

I was like why 

Ur post made it all clear thanks op Instead of crying wolf, have you thought of quitting from zomato or swiggy? That way you don't need to worry about being cheated. u/Bluebaleno damn my mom was right all long, good that she forces me to get up my lazy ass and go to the restaurant from where I want the food. Never actually thought about the restaurant owners. I’ve also noticed that there’s a discrepancy in the prices quoted in the Zomato/Swiggy apps & those quoted on the actual menus in the restaurant. The prices on the app are higher by at least 20 rupees for almost every item. With all the major food delivery apps ZOMATO, UberEats and Swiggy are all operating at a loss. So, I think only the consumers are winning. It's not a 'scam'. It's called the market. These apps can charge whatever margin they want. If you don't like you can order from an alternative.

It's not like there is some law fixing food prices on Zomato. Just being the devil's advocate here for what OP mentions. What's a sustainable business model for them? bare in mind these are not just the only costs.

\- Personnel cost  this includes the tech people(paid premium packages given that the scale is huge) and the delivery

\- Operating server costs (No ordinary stuff considering the reliability and availability requirements of such a massive business)

\- Payment gateway fees(usually \~4% maybe slightly lower due to their scale.)

\- Losses ruled in favor of the  customer.- Making up for the discount's offered to lure more consumer base especially fickle consumers in India and advertising.

Its naive to just look at it from an end consumer perspective. Anyone whose run an online business must know how much money is spent on the intangibles. I personally understand when consumers/stakeholders like OP post this but their expectations are ignorant at times if not inconsiderate.  


Having said that I do not like the discount being forced down your throat OP, OP could you confirm if there is an opt out of such discount for you guys?  


PS: I've worked for quite a few startups under the e-commerce umbrella as a tech guy, such margins are norm. TIL that corporations are sleazy. Imagine that! FML! Have you imagined that without zomato or swiggy you couldn't sell the burger in the first place! No one will travel 5km for a burger!

There no concept called ""potential sale"". Without food delivery service you can't even sell the burger. Very difficult to read and understand your post man. But Delivery companies will obviously charge you,  they are delivering your food to the costumer plus they are providing you a platform to get discovered by more and more people.

The only issue I can see here is the forced discount thing because they app is providing/claiming discount not the restaurant , so apps should give discount from their pocket . Can someone please explain me this properly? I think you people should try forming some kind of unions. So Zomato and Swiggy have no one to get food from and they are forced to treat you guys better. Upvoting for better reach. If you can't afford then why don't you stop the promotion/discount? I bet no app put gun on your head. You could say no to discount. The model the apps are running are not sustainable as of now, I know. We all know these details. I heard some south Indian state is going to take action. See if you could help in the cause. PS: 230 for a burger? Damn.  That's too expensive for me. I'm a broke ass students so I wouldn't know what it's like to eat 230 RS burger. Even the zinger is 140ish something I guess. Do restaurants prepare higher quality food for non discounted over the phone orders? The places I used to order from a couple of years ago delivered great food although at higher prices. Now when I order through apps I've noticed even though the bill is cheaper the quality is not at par in a lot of places. Is this done by restaurants to try to keep up with the discounts? Thanks for sharing. Really appreciate your experience in this. I don't fully understand your problem with the delivery charge though — isn't that a part of their expenses? We as customers should pay some amount for it, right?

Also, I hope you don't mind but it's a little difficult to understand your post. As you mentioned, this isn't your first language and I truly respect your effort in trying to inform us on this important issues.

Here's how I would edit your post, if it helps, try seeing what I've cut out. Will help you write clearer the next time.

*""Hi, I own a restaurant and I just wanted to bring something to light. This is the reason why your food is expensive.*

*Companies like Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats charge us restaurants a 25 per cent commission on every order we get. For example, a burger sells for Rs. 250. Minus the commission, it is Rs. 200.* 

*On top of that, their discounts end up killing restaurants and bring the value down even further for us. For example, Zomato's 40-per cent discount of Zomato will cost me Rs. 50-70 rupees on the same burger, which I would end up selling for Rs.130. On top of that is a 5 per cent GST.*

*This unethical behaviour is killing restaurants and local businesses.*

*2) They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 25-35 rupees for delivery per order. Zomato earns almost 100 rupees from you and I. I understand it's a business model, but you need profits and the discounts that they are running will shut us down. Your favourite small time businesses will shut down very soon if this continues.*

*TL;DR:  Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats cheat restaurants and customers with their pricing and discount schemes.*

*I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language. It's actually one of the few times I've written in English, and that too, on such a long topic. Hope you understand!""* Always knew there has to be something behind those crazy discounts. Looks like the restaurant is being fucked over by the Companies. You get orders because of Zomato. Zomato has the right to enter into arrangement with you and it is up to you to accept or not.

Don't understand the issue here. It seems like you just want to make more money while having the  same volume as you get through Zomato. Can't have it both ways. In a free market economy, fairness in competition is touted to be the usp. In reality, it is the market itself that makes profit while the long tail of market participants die. Those that survive are usually owned by the market itself.

For e.g. if you're swiggy, the bowl company (owned by swiggy) belongs to the top 5% and brings in much more revenue than the entire long tail combined causing them to shut down. Similar with Amazon's brands like solimo etc.

In essence, this is anti competitive and would have resulted in the government to intervene, had it been some other country. The only real force stopping anti competitive practices is legislation, which our country is pissant at. I live in Singapore, I'm not sure about the markets here, but what happens there is that the sellers increase the price of the items available on the apps. You can get the same thing for about 70% the cost if you buy it directly from the restaurant. Can confirm. 22-25% of revenue goes to Zomato Swiggy. Jacking up prices to list therefore is inevitable. Good business opportunity to help small restaurants set up mobile optimized store fronts and bypass swiggy or tomato As a restaurant owner what changes would you like to see?  
Any proposal on how to let the such companies earn also?  
If the company didn't offer delivery but, just listed your menu will you get into an agreement with them? I have absolutely no problem with this.Those delivery orders would never be available for you without those apps.You will be serving to the same customer base and delivery to same people who order and live with in 10-15 minutes of your restaurant.

While I have no doubt the food apps engage in some scummy behavior and strong arm restaurants, restaurateurs need to realize that extra delivery business orders that they generate will not be available for them without these apps.How you choose to deal with that is their prerogative.

I wont order from a restaurant that is pretty far away from my location unless its through the food delivery apps.My business will be limited to nearby restaurants.Its the delivery apps that enable restaurants to get orders from outside their normal circle.You cant expect to get maximum profit from these.",2019-05-22 00:28:06
Food,Just had Indian food for the first time. I am speechless.,241,bxojlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bxojlb/just_had_indian_food_for_the_first_time_i_am/,138,1559898490.0,"Hello /r/india,

I did not know where else to post this, so I hope this is appropriate. I've never in my life tried Indian food until today. Where I work, at the cafeteria, I decided I would try some Indian food. I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree. 

Here are my options for that:

https://imgur.com/uZ9XO4M",WinRARHF," Personally I'm a non Indian who loves all things India. I'm a mostly white girl from Indiana. (no relation, lolol)

I love both butter chicken, which I think you had, and chicken tikka masala.  Those are great easy starters. A biryani is a meat mixed with rice dish. Unless it says veggie biryani lol. 

Tarka dal (various spellings) is delicious, that's a lentil dish.  Any dal is a lentil dish, those are staples and there are a million kinds but a few classics. Chana means chick pea.  there are ""saag""  dishes, these are greens. Spinach, etc. If it says aloo that means potato. Paneer is a kind of un-aged cheese, like queso blanco. Something described as pakora will be fried. 

Then there are all the pickles and chutneys. 

Most things will be richly flavorful but they don't have to be spicy the way a lot of people think about that word.

Edit: thanks for all the love on this comment. You guys are great. 

I'm going to admit some cultural appropriation here. I have a tattoo that is an Indian saying written in Sanskrit. It was r/India who helped me decide the best way to write it, and what you guys came up with makes it a paradox, which I love. It reads both ""a garland in a monkey's hand"" and ""a garland in Lord Vishnu's hand"". I got it as an homage to my love of India and as a reminder to myself to not be the monkey OR the garland. To be a good steward of the delicate and the vulnerable both in myself and in others. 

To those who might take offense that I did that, I am sorry. I know it's kind of gauche but I love my tattoo & get compliments on it almost daily--there are flowers around it, specific flowers with specific meanings, and it's done in a henna kind of style. Thus far, no one has told me that it actually says ""waiting for the number six bus"" so I'm hoping it doesn't... There's a high chance you just tried India's greatest gift to the culinary world - butter chicken. 

What you should order tomorrow really depends on what kind of flavours you like. Since you're just exploring, try the chicken tikka masala, and pair it up with a couple of naans of your choice. Did you buy WinRAR license? Hi OP ! There is a sub dedicated to r/IndianFood if you want to dive deeper. And you might get more nuanced suggestions there.  Also my choice from your list would be the 'Methi CHicken' as it will be completely different from what you tried yesterday(probably CHicken tikka masala. Ha-ha, welcome to your lifelong addiction my friend-take it from one who knows, once you pop, you just can't stop. I'm a 51 year old white guy from a provincial town in the UK. My first experience was aged 15 in an Indian corner shop called 'Johals' in my hometown. Knew the guys in there fairly well to talk to. Went in one day for milk and spotted a box of triangular pastries on the counter..

""What are those Mr Johal?"" 

""They're samosas RajBandar"" 

""What's a surmiser?"" 

""Samosa. They're nice, try one, free of charge"" 

I thanked him & walked out of the shop. Went up the road munching it, and despite the *tiny* amount of chilli inside blowing my head into orbit & making my eyes and nose pour,(I'd never tasted chili before this)  I'll never forget biting down on a freshly roasted cumin seed and letting that floral, earthy flavour bomb detonate and dance across my tastebuds. Twenty five years later I got on a plane at Heathrow for Delhi. In a happy miracle it all happened again! The Indian food I'd experienced at home was sort of the same but in India..my god, I can't describe the first time I had a simple thali and a garlic naan. I stepped into the desi elevator and took a straight vertical ride to food heaven. And a literal auto ride to Old Delhi. I could bore the shit out of this sub for *hours* rattling on about soft galuti kebabs, gossamer-thin rumali roti, daulat ki chaat disappearing on my tongue, *feeling* diabetes setting in after two gulab jamoon & some burfi from Haldiram, not caring and having more....etc etc. Even a simple masala chai on the corner and talking gupshup with the chaiwallah unkill while I drink it brings me deep joy these days. Especially when he opens the tin he keeps under the counter, opens it and offers it to me, saying *""Biskoot?""* 

If any other *gorapakora's* are reading this and thinking about travelling to India to sample her delights, edible & otherwise, stop thinking & do it., you won't be sorry. If you're anything like me you'll be unequivocally, incurably, head-over-heels in love from the outset.

Edit; I'm still getting on planes 12 ish years later and going to India. Trip number ten in the autumn and nine months has been too long for this masala junkie. I'm straining at the leash to get back, see you soon *Mataji Bharat* ❤️ Chicken Tikka Masala is something I've heard a lot of non-indians like. So you can try that. Most of these are going to be similar to one another. No way this place has that much differentiation sitting around. I would go with Chicken Kadhai, it's a bit spicer than the others. Go for dosa and chutney/sambar during breakfast lol. Many non Indians like that..
Have tea/coffee along with that. Should be good. 

Tastes even better if it's raining outside! Come to India lol. You'll be mind blown. You should try biryani. Try indian sweets like gulag Jamie, rashgulla, jalebi Considering those are options that you have, then try them in the following order. Have them with naan, or tandoori roti or just plain rice. Order a side of green salad or make one at home.  

1. Chicken Korma
2. Chicken Muglai
3. Chicken Kadai
4. Butter Chicken
5. Chicken Tikka Masala
6. Chicken Saag
7. Chicken Jalfrezi
8. Chicken Curry
9. Chicken Vindalo
10. Chicken Kolapuri

This is sorted from least to most spicy, so that you get accustomed to the spices and be light on your stomach. 

A little lime goes a long way with these dishes.

And as u/thelielmao mentioned take care of your stomach, indian food will play a number on you, so pace yourself. Now you know the reason for 2 things.  

Western Colonization of Indian sub-continent.  
Western Youtube channels with their Indian-Food-tasting videos jacking up their view and subscriber count by multiple orders of magnitude. Glad you liked Indian food! There is a lot of variety in terms of cuisines and flavors as they change depending on the geography they come from. I hope you like the other types of Indian food too! Cheers! r/IndianFood Bloomington, MN. :)

Enjoy Indian food. It's a drug. Just remember there are mainly three types of famous delicious chicken cuisines:

  
1. **Butter chicken**, mouth watering! hell fucking lot of calories. But it's ok to have some times, i'd suggest to have it with butter nan. Not everyone can give you the real taste of it, check reviews before ordering.

2. **Afghani chicken**, named differently depending upon place to place.. it's works as starter with drinks, it's basically chicken with lot of cream on it, it's totally yum! again high in calories but not as high as BC.

3. **Tandoori Chicken**, baked in [tandoor](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt/229253608/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt.png). Basically a spicy chicken marinated with indian masalas and roasted in Tandoors. It also works best with a beer, also less in calories(though also depends upon how much oil you put).  


These are main three chicken cuisines, you should try, rest of the things mentioned on menu are branched from these three only. Also, these three are named differently depending upon place to place. Tell you what, chicken tikka masala with either roomali rotis and a cheese garlic naan.

Butter chicken with plain naan and rice.

Chicken kadahi with naan.

These would be the most preferred combinations here. Then you can sample the rest. 

But be sure to have some water nearby. I have seen a few Europeans eat the same dishes with gusto in Goa and then be covered in perspiration. 

All the best! I LOVE THIS THREAD. You've have had lot of chicken dishes suggestion, I'll just say do try some Indian veg food too, it will get you an appreciation of veg food. first step done, now try cricket. [deleted] Try Jalfrezi next time.

On a side now, I hope your body is ready for tomorrow.

Don't 'lose' hope, exotic food will reshape your gut flora! 😂 [deleted]

Is good a sub You should choose depending on your spice bearing ability and how spicy that particular restaurant makes it. Butter chicken and Chicken korma would be kinda less spicy usually. A good korma would be delicious with Indian breads. Butter chicken is a classic. You could also try these curries with ""ghee rice"" or plain rice. You can ask for ghee rice they would probably make it for you.  Chicken Vindaloo is a goan preparation that is vinegary and goes well with plain rice more than breads. The rest are more suited to be had with breads. You can try Chicken Mughalai once !! r/IndianFood",2019-06-07 14:38:10
Photography,Inside Mysore Palace.

Some high profile kids got into  serious trouble for doing a photoshoot inside. 

If you take pictures, dont post on social media sites. Woah it has some optical illusion going-on on the floor Please post this in r/incredibleindia post it at r/pics DMT palace you mean? ;p Imagine walking down this lane while being high. I went here as a kid, other than the photos as proof I barely remember it. Need to go there once again. We went on a Sunday in December 2018. My companion, who'd been there before, was surprised to see visitors freely photographing the Palace from inside and not being asked to refrain from doing so. So I suppose they've relaxed the rules. I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace. The inside of my sore place looks way......shittier This beauty is unparalleled Hey OP, saw that glass window which looks like nothing is there? On the 1st floor? Where? Beautiful indeed thanks OP Mysore Palace is really beautiful. Great aperture with this phone's camera looking with the picture capability... Nic pic.

Pristine and well maintained legacy ! Nice Palace. i liked it. i love to explore this kind of places. +1 for taking care of the symmetry. Wow this is really beautiful.. love the symmetry Looks like there renovations are finally done. Have to plan a visit soon! 
Beautiful pic OP 👍 Looks like an optical illusion 😅 Omg India is so beautiful Let's see how you make your way outside! great Wow! So Amazing Beautiful. that is so beautiful. Nice pic pal r/trippy r/pics breathtaking /r/ArchitecturePorn It looks awesome WOW.... Wow been there but my pictures are not like this. You should see inside Mysore ass. o: Photography isn't allowed in there mate. 

Delete this post Once upon a time there was great India Mysore 😍 All of you complaining about the processing this has gone through. It doesn’t matter as long as it looks good to the person who shot it. 
Bumping up the exposure and saturation on this gives it life and just look at it as a form of artistic expression. Peace. Great picture buddy 👌🏽 can’t believe it was taken on a mobile phone.

Great work 👍🏽 https://youtu.be/PTqtrGBYpxQ Kinda hate that everyone who took pictures at this spot in Mysore Palace have 'cut-out' the first arch from the frame. Why -_- Wow!! this beauty is awesome. Really our India is incredible. Fantastic pic. OMG! That looks absolutely stunning... Simply amazing!!",2019-06-12 19:57:17

I slogged through most of my college days, somehow managing an meagre five pointer.

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",okchinmayarawat," Slog through and get a proper job first side by side do photography. [Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby. Perhaps consider joining merchant navy and combine your education and passion. Check out videos of [JeffHK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGpdSarF_FdCygiA1tOl6Cg/videos) \- he does photography and good YouTube videos as a hobby while serving on a merchant vessel.

You can join photography college/school. There are many. Also look into online classes

If you've a DSLR, try practicing on your own. Shoot in manual. 

Also parallely, learn photoshop/GIMP/Lightroom. People find it tough. But post-processing is necessary specially when shooting Raw.",2019-06-25 19:07:29

Great framing.

Some more details please, like focal length, whether you processed the film 🎞 yourself, etc. Beautiful capture... lovely contours I wish I was on a 35mm film 😩 Love the composition! Wow, what a beautiful photograph! Do you have an Instagram or any other page where I can see more of your work? Very cool On an actual film or a full frame camera? This shot is a work of art! Great work, OP. Why does film look better than digital? Thanks for a new wallpaper Such a beautiful photograph. 

And I really wish people could see the reality of the garbage around this iconic monument. Just filth. Vote judiciously or else it will be renamed as char-mandir.

Saw Charminar when I was little. Such a beautiful monument it is. The surrounding market place is beautiful too. This brings back memories. The colors in this picture are so soothing. What are the pros of analog over digital? Perfect shot 
Super Great shot! I am from hyderabad and went to charminar like 100 times but I never observed these details. Beautiful ✨ Nice to see film still being used. Something about a film camera that makes you slow down and compose the shots. Nice dynamic range as well I don't live in Hyderabad anymore, and I've been missing the city quite a bit since I moved, so thank you for this wonderful photo - it's beautiful and reminds me of home ♡ Do you mean Chatur Mandir?

Is there a story where a dude/dudette worked hard, got a camera on his/her own savings and the started pursuing it as a hobby? I would love to hear what you guys think. I might come off as rude and cynical but this thought has been bugging me for some time now.",thisisatypo," My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person’s hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person’s hobby.
P.S. don’t get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today’s smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai.",2019-06-05 19:34:03

One my cousin passed his 10th class in 2018 and later joined intermediate by force of his father. He stopped going to college and gone crazy. Started all sorts of habits like smoking, drinking, roaming and not coming to home for 3 to 4 days.

He messed it up very badly.

My brother got irritated and broght him home and beat the shit out of him.

Now my brother was asking me to suggest some course or some work so that he is more engaged or busy with that.

Can you please provide what a completed 10th class student can do and what kind of opportunities helps him grow better?

My suggestions:
1. Typing institute
2. ITI
3. Any vocational course

Any suggestions you people got?

Edit: They are lower middle class. His father is drunkard and mother commited suscide (6years back). After that everything is bourne by their elder parents and their sons.

TIA",nograduation," If he's interested, maybe Animation and VFX To be honest the best thing a 10 th pass can do is complete 12 th and then graduation.This is not even education, this is basic that is expected from you. Even graduates are struggling to get a job and are compensating with skills.I have heard even Uber is making mandatory for a driver to be at least 12 pass. How could you expect someone who has only completed 10 th to live a decent respected life without education and job.Excess Smoking, drinking are a halo effect of life not living to the standard so that you can forget the pain. I am sorry to hear about your friends family situation.i dont need to explain the important of education to someone who uses reddit. You already know  what is best for him. Just make him understand rationally with logic. We can only plant seeds but he need to grow himself. I see that you said he likes photography. If that is the case, I would recommend him to become an intern or an assistant at a local studio. It will not pay him much but at least he will be more engaged in that and will also gain some work experience. 

After that, if he thinks he needs to move on, he can be an assistant at a larger studio. Since he already has experience, he could be accepted. Then, work his way through and also consider an art degree (if possible) if he wants to go further. Don't you think this kid troubled by some mental tension or stress?

As high school student this kid could be going through a lot then you can think, the death of his mother and drunken father, this kinda of stuff hits hard on kids mind,

This attitude could be a rewinding cycle to bear the pain he has in life, you better find out what's going on his mind 12th pass karao and rashtriya rifles ki Bharti me bithao...",2019-05-02 06:34:31

AMA,Congress social media head Divya Spandana deletes Twitter handle,76,bw5y0q,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-social-media-head-divya-spandana-deletes-twitter-handle/article27406128.ece,19,1559560485.0,,harddisc," IIRC she was on reddit and didnt answer much.. So everyone can be fired for not performing their job except the ones at the top? The one at the top who cribbed that various leaders were promoting their sons (instead of party) but decided to make his sister to head the party in Eastern UP? How many seats did Mrs Priyanka Gandhi Vadra win in Eastern UP? I believe Congress is replacing her with someone new on this post. Recent election results are enough to say she not really good at being ""social media head"" of a huge party and that AMA was really something 😅. They need to get someone with real professional experience if she is fired then that's a good sign. Seems fair to me if that is the case. She should come back in movies.

AMA,So this happened yesterday [R],609,bcz7em,https://imgur.com/DJXElBz,77,1555244828.0,,High24x7," the fact that they are acknowledging the problem and giving you a refund instead of a 50 rupees coupon is surprisingly good So after chain snatching, food snatching is common now. Recently zomato delivery guy was also skeptical about giving me my order until I showed him the app and the order. He said people have been snatching orders recently. Which city is this? 

Happened to me once in Gurgaon. Two guys snatched a couple of pizzas from the delivery boy. He was very apologetic about it but I had to tell him not to worry. I don't expect him to fight with two burly guys over a fucking pizza. #justgurgaonthings :P Wtf? Is food order snatching a thing now? He's said it so calmly ,like this is a common thing that happens every now and then [removed] ""... delivery agent has *confirmed* that somebody snatched the order..""

He had to check twice to make sure they just wouldn't run around the block and give it back :D

It's pretty hilarious but I guess it's also worth noting that it's dangerous to be a food delivery person at 12:00am.

Edit: Fix Quote and typos This is hilarious ! The next time make sure to snatch the order yourself. :D FIR file kro. Cctv recordings check kro. We live in a society OP is ordering at 1230 am with 9% battery . Bad luck indeed ! Not sure if reddiquette is the appropriate tag here. Were you expecting to kickstart a conversation on prevalence of forcible dispossession of packaged sustenance from mobile vehicle-mounted agents in Indian urban spheres? Pretty sure this must be in NCR Lmao [removed] He took exactly 2 more minutes lol Happened with me on uber eats, turns out there was a strike among drivers so they were the ones who attacked 🤦‍♂️ After reading the comments now I realized why Zomato delivery guys started asking me from which name the order was placed. It all makes sense now r/uselessgreencircle Which city? Pretty common occurrence where I live in Gurgaon.. :/ r/wellthatsucks Man..! I need to keep an eye on my lunch box. Wow that's crazy This is apparently very common. There are 'black zones' in every city where such things happen. Delivery guys get kidnapped into the house, their wallets and food stolen and they are beaten before they are let go. Not sure if police cases get filed in such cases. Loool!!! love the honesty",2019-04-14 17:57:08

Sorry, 10/10 or no AMA :) 2001 feels like ages ago.. TIL: Parsees pray in 🔥 temples. Where did 0.25 of the marks go? I couldn't find anything wrong. You should have asked for re-eval. What Is The First Thing You Think Of When You Wake In The Morning? Is this GK or religious studies? Ahh the good old days. 3/4 lmao Nine and three quarters. 

Is this Indian Hogwarts? 9¾? But there no such thing as 9¾..is there? Try going into the paper and see if you end up in the Hogwarts train. 😁 .5 marks for Delhi instead of New Delhi ? I really liked how the paper was very secular , gave you information about somr major religions which most people I know don't know about Where are you now? It’s interesting that most of the questions are about religion. Why is the country obsessed with religion? You are one year senior to me. 

How's life, spyder? Nerd alert! India Father: Why couldn't you score 10/10? Sharmaji ke ladke se kuch seekhle.

In question 2 with the options given, I'm reminded of a story told by my parents about me in first standard where I had a similar question with 5 parts and 5 options given. I apparently marked 4 of them correctly and left the fifth blank and when asked about it said that I didn't know the answer to the fifth one so that's why I left it.

lol never heard of  a person getting 3/4 Shout out to a fellow Goan 👌 Fodrecha I was 1 year old when you attempted this paper :( But you got only 6½ marks Show-off!! Wow, where you from in Goa? Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of General Knowledge? Based on the 1st question you have answered, I'd like to ask you, what do you think should be done about the Kashmir issue. Not as an Indian, but as a humanitarian. What's the name of this school ? How did  you prepare for the exam saar?All india rank must be 200-300 mein. Sharmaji ke bete ko poore 10 mile thhe does 3/4th exist today? Bois.... How come teacher give Delhi as right answer it must be New Delhi. Did you used to impress teacher like we all do to become class monitor 😂😂 Was your GK sir a Kar Sevak ? Capital of India is New Delhi technically. Also please give your location - it should be North India. North of India makes it look at if Kashmir is a separate entity from India. Being an Atheist it sucks to see how religion is fed into a kid's brain before they learn science and stuff... This prevents them from questioning their religion.",2019-07-15 04:29:40

AMA,I am an Indian getting married to a Pakistani girl later this summer.

Amidst recent tensions between both the countries and general temperament of the people, it was a challenge to get people to agree to this arrangement. The only thing that made it easier is the fact that we are both muslim. I am a proud Indian and love my country, however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues. It has been highly stressful psychologically as well.

I wanted to share this experience that I endured for a year and the troubles we both faced in the light of modern politics and peoples mindsets. To give you some background: I am from Bangalore, born and bought up and she is from Lahore, we both met in London at uni where we fell In love and decided to get married. Go ahead, ask me anything!",muaazkhn," So, reverse Sania Mirza!

Congrats! Which side has better Biryani? Also congratulations op! Who will your kids support during Ind vs Pak?
**Congratulations anyway** I just want to congratulate you! Wish you a very happy married life!! Name you're kid Kashmir. Do play Lahore by Guru Randhawa on your wedding if you can. It would be fun. [deleted] Wow, British are finally making amends! Congrats op! How hot are her friends man? Please seek blessings from Mudikaka. What were your parents reaction when you told the about the marriage? 
Also, what religion will you be teaching your children if at all you want to. Unless you plan to stay internationally you're bound to face huge problems in bringing her to India and her going back to Pakistan for visits etc.given the tense situation which can blow up anytime into a war like one.

How'd you plan to handle it? Congratulations! Punjaban, good luck man. What did her parents and relatives have to say about the arrangement? Congratulations man! God bless you both! Dating a Pakistani was fun when I was in London, but I wouldn’t have had the balls to marry one. Kudos!

Just remember one thing, even if you guys end up getting British citizenship, Indian govt for the purpose of immigration when you enter the country won’t allow her a visa on arrival that other Brit citizens are eligible for since she would be an ex-Pakistani citizen. 

However, that is atleast about 7 years away, so meanwhile she would be getting these short term visas. And by short term I’m talking in days and not months. Max my Pakistani friend who got married to an Indian from WB has gotten is 45 days. He is a  green card holder, she has American passport with PIO. 

Don’t let these small irritants deter you from celebrating the glory of your marriage. 

God bless you two again! Congrats!

Do both of u plan on changing your citizenship to become UK citizens?

Also which university did both of u go to?😂 Are you planning to introduce your wife to some nice Idly/Chutney from SLV and Masala Dosa from CTR? was she da bomb though? (no offense xd) Congratulations dude!

Are you a UK citizen ? If not are you hopeful of getting citizenship. Better settle there mate, things will be pretty bad in case you have to go back home. 

Are your parents questioned by  relatives/neighbors about this entire episode or they have kept it hidden so far. Are you Muslim?

Out of curiosity

&#x200B;

\>however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues

&#x200B;

is this due to political differences between india/pak ie nationalism (If so more from pakistan side or indian side)? Or are there significant cultural differences causing this?

Also what kind of cultural differences have u faced in dating her? Good for you & her. Congrats. Benglur ke musalmaana ka naam roshan karreen bhai. Harrow or Newham? Where are you guys getting married? Are we invited? >  I am from Bangalore, born and bought up and she is from Lahore, we both  met in London at uni where we fell In love and decided to get married. 

Stay in London. Your future wife is also dong an AMA? If not, asl her abd sharethr link too So what’s the marriage called ? Samjhauta Express ? I don't believe you. Better send me an invitation and allow me to check the food counter to verify if they are authentic Indian or Pakistan cuisine. 



XD. Congrats OP! You are very wholesome person OP.... 

Also when you go to Lahore make sure you know the location of all handpumps  :P When you are getting married don't bring a cat/kitten in a basket :p I wonder what would've happened if you belonged to some other religion. Hey, congrats man!

AMA,India's first indigenous processor developed at IIT Bombay. I am a designer AMA!!,4342,bfrh0g,https://i.redd.it/37dmt3wfnnt21.jpg,623,1555897670.0,,prabot," Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.


There is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?

b. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?

c. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..

1. Which module(s) were you part of?

2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?

3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?

4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?

5. What was your preferred method for DFT?

6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?

7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?

8. Is this our own fab? I'm dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.

Thanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I'm a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this? Wasn't the 1st microprocessor developed by IIT Madras? Shakti.  How is it different from it & can it compete with Intel? Can we build a low cost Raspberry Pi/Arduino alternative with this chip? Or what kind of hardware specs are yet to be integrated in this for one to realise a functioning SBC for the DIY maker community. Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm really interested in the field of architecture.
Does this processor implement pipelining? Does it dispatch instructions in order or does it implement out of order dispatch/processing? Why not RISC? What is the design team size at IITB? I assume the final synthesis, verification, and layout was done in Cadence? How many design cycles did you need before taping out the final version? Sorry for too many questions! Once the final version is out into mass production, can we have a course like *NAND to Tetris*, where they try to teach us how an entire computer is built out of nand gate. 

Something like this for electronics(in this case the design) which will ease the fear and improve the understanding, of course this should come out in free time How much did it cost to develop this processor? Is this the same as developed in IIT Madras?? Which was fabricated for free at Oregon? Wow. This is amazing!!

I'm guessing this is based on open source hardware. Is the architecture of this cpu available to take a look at? Congratulations! Can you give a bit of a overview of what it is capable of? What kind of skills would i need to become a part of something like this? I'm currently doing my undergrad in ECE. Which subjects should i focus more on to develop the skills you have to make a chip like this? Hey,

While I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.

>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.

Untrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It's like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.

Bluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.

>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.

Mate, don't expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.

>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.

I don't know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)

Or that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU's? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)

Or that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)

The only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -

>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.

[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)

>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can't reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.

So then don't call it India's first indigenous processor. Call it India's first indigenous processor-design language and not India's **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.

Anyways, it doesn't matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments. If you call yourself an academician working at a prestigious place like IITB, you should put a bit more thought into your responses. Are you planning to do MBA from IIMA as well. What's the cost compared to an Intel/AMD processor? And clock speed? What was the most challenging part? Are you from electronics or CSE? As a cse student from another iit this sounds a great development and shows the amount of hard work you guys put in research. Congratulations!  
 
PS : hire me in next placement season What is the purpose of creating this processor? Do you see India as a competent nation Atleast in terms of necessary resources for setting international industrial standards for this chip in near future(10-15 years)?

Summing up,can we use these chips like the pic/Arm/Avr in anytime in future or is it too early to call a shot? Congrats! Any plans for a retail development board? What is the full form of AJIT? What were your biggest challenges ? When was this accomplished? [Link to the detailed article](https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor)

P.S : Thanks to u/kash_if Congrats!

Are you going to release it publically? Like for use in phones and computers? Or is it going to be reserved for research purposes?

Also how is it better than currently used processors? i seem to be more interested in how did you get involved. i have similar ambitions. could you, please? How good is fabrication from SCL? Are you going to open source the instruction set, bootloader code, etc? Where can I download the RTL, is it there on opencores? Business Perspective: Will India be into processor fabrication, like how it is into IT services. Do we have required raw materials and the process to fabricate with cost lesser than importing one. I have a more general question. China is investing a lot in semiconductors in order to reduce chip imports. It also has companies like HiSilicon which is aiming for competing with the likes of Qualcomm. India is obviously not quite there yet but there have been voices calling for this for years.

How realistic should we be with our expectations? When could we see an Indian competitors to these kinds of companies? Do you think the state needs to step in the way it has in China with massive financial support or do you think the private sector can do it on its own with some collaboration with academia? Thanks. You've heard of Raspberry Pi. This summer...Ajit Pi.... Will you employ americans to do your telephone support? - Is the tech used on par with what other international makers are using? Where do we fall behind? 

- Why would a device maker use this processor instead of commercially available similar processors?

- How far is it from mass production? Will it even be mass produced or just remain a lab experiment?

- Why do you think are we so far behind in this space? Almost all developed countries have dozens of fab plants and India has just one? Why is govt. not investing in this industry, this industry alone could give a massive boost to the Indian economy? What instruction set? [deleted] 1)Does it require its own motherboard or is it compatible with commercial available mobo.                    
   2) How will you compare it with current gen CPU of Intel and AMD,like which processor will it be comparable to.             
               3)How much RAM it supoort How far is it from mass production? When could we see any company or you announcing real world products? I don't really have a question - just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team - hope this endeavor continues to even greater heights. Well done! Where is the technical documentation? Is this going to be an open core? That is so fucking cool.",2019-04-22 07:17:50
